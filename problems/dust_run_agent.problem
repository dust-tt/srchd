Dust is a SaaS platform allowing the creation and use of agents in user workplaces.

Agent actions are intermediated by the MCP protocol (even internal actions). One action is `run_agent` which calls back into Dust to run a sub-agent in a different conversation.

We're seeing 2 types of errors (see CSV extract from Datadog below) with that action that are generating noise. Investigate each of these errors and propose an explanation for the error as well as proposed fix.

Dust codebase consists in the Dust main repository[0] as well as the Dust infra repository[1]. You can clone each of these repositories to investigate the issues.
