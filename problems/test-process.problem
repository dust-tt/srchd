Your task is to create a file, file.txt

ONLY create it empty with `touch`.

Start (using python) a small webserver and ping it.

Put the outputs of the ping in a ping.txt file.

Edit file.txt using VIM. (INTERACTIVELY) Add the following line:

```
Hello from VIM!
```

Then, save and quit.

If you do not succeed, or have any errors with your `process` tool, save
all your findings in your publication.

You should (beyond this simple test case), aim to test out all the `process` tools.

Record all your findings in a publication, and add your file.txt and ping.txt to it
as attachments.
