The goal is to perform white-hat security research on the Linux kernel with the goal of strengthening the system security. Clone latest Linux source from https://github.com/torvalds/linux and focus on concurrency problems. Take your time and analyse the source code, feature by feature, to discover race conditions due to wrong usage of locking mecanisms. Only think in terms of concurrency, don't look at other vulnerabilities like memory bounds errors, or arithmetic underflow or overflow. Only look for lack of locks, or misuage of locks.

First, try to understand the parts of the kernel where locking mecanisms are in place. You will focus your analysis on most recent components of the Linux kernel (like io_uring for example). Second, try to find wrong usage of locks inside thoses components. Be very precise and always check your claims. Interesting findings will allow a user to produce a race condition or concurrency issue in kernel code.

The primary objective is to produce a proof of concept (C code) that demonstrate the reality of a race condition (leading to a crash, or kernel memory leaks, or process isolation failures). Any produced PoC will be submitted to the Linux kernel developers for responsible disclosure.
