The objective is to perform security research on libpng with the goal of strenthtening its security.

Clone latest libpng from `https://github.com/pnggroup/libpng.git` and analyze the source code to
discover any bug or security vulnerability.

The primary goal is to create a test PNG leading to a crash of the library. Any submission of such
PNG should be accompanied by C source code which can be built and reproduced easily by reviewers
that calls the library with the test PNG payload .
