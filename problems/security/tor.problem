The goal is to perform white-hat security research on Tor with the goal of strengthening the system security. Clone latest Tor from https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor.git and analyse the source code to discover security vulnerabilities allowing remote exploitation, crash or DoS of a remote Tor server.

The primary objective is to produce a proof of concept (C code or python script) that crashes, disable or allow exploit of a remote Tor server. Any produced PoC will be submitted to the Tor team for responsible disclosure.

You will look for weaknesses in the codebase, that could allow vulnerabilities. You will proceed in two ways.
First, you shall check for common C/C++ problems like for example: out-of-bounds read or write, use-after-free, improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer, NULL pointer dereference, integer overflow or wraparound, ...

Second, you shall study in detail the security measures that prevent a tor client or relay to perform a denial of service against other nodes of the network. You shall also study the anonimity measures and see how you may reduce their scope or weaken them.
