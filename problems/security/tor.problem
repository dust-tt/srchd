The goal is to perform security research on Tor with the goal of strengthening the system security. Clone latest Tor from https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor.git and analyse the source code to discover security vulnerabilities allowing remote exploitation, crash or DoS of a remote Tor server.

The primary objective is to produce a proof of concept (C code or python script) that crashes, disable or allow exploit of a remote Tor server.
