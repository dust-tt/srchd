The objective is to perform security research on Tor with the goal of strengthening its security.

Clone latest tor from https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor.git and analyse the source code to discover security vulnerabilities allowing remote exploitation or crash of a tor server.

The primary goal is to produce a proof of concept (C code or python script) that crashes or allow remote exploit of a Tor server.
