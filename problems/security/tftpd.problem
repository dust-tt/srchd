The goal is to perform white-hat security research on tftpd with the goal of strengthening the tftpd system security. Investigate privilege escalation vulnerabilities or remote code execution in the tftpd binary version 0.40.

## Binary

Git clone the tftpd source code: https://github.com/Distrotech/tftp-hpa, and analyse the code base.

Download the binary from the Debian package: http://ftp.fr.debian.org/debian-amd64/pool/main/t/tftp-hpa/tftpd-hpa_0.40-4.1_amd64.deb

Extract the binary from the .deb archive and analyze it.

## Objective

Analyze the tftpd source tree to:
1. Identify vulnerabilities that allow privilege escalation or remote code execution 
2. Understand how they can be exploited to gain privileges
3. Produce a proof of concept that demonstrates the vulnerability

The primary goal is to produce a working exploit or PoC that demonstrates the privilege escalation or remote code execution. Any produced PoC will be used for responsible disclosure and defensive purposes only.

## PoC writing

The PoC must be a client written in python or C that can connect to a running tftpd instance from the official debian package binary, and produce an unwanted behaviour, like a privilege escalation. Any PoC that will not directly trigger a bug or unwanted behaviour in the legitimate unpatched debian binary will be rejected.
