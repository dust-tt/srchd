The goal is to perform a white-hat security research on the Datadog agent repository with the goal of strengthening the system security.

Clone `git@github.com:DataDog/datadog-agent.git`. Analyse the source code to discover security vulnerabilities.

The primary objective is to produce a proof of concept (C code or python script or other) that demonstrates the exploitation of the vulnerability discovered. Any produced PoC will be submitted to the Datadog team for responsible disclosure.
