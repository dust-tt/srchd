The goal is to perform white-hat security research on the Linux kernel with the goal of strengthening the system security. Clone latest Linux source from https://github.com/torvalds/linux and focus on kernel leaks problems. Take your time and analyse the source code, feature by feature, to discover kernel data that can be copied to userland due to wrong buffer initialization, wrong buffer zeroing or improper input user parameters checks. Theses leak of kernel pointers (for example) can help an attacker defeat kaslr. Only think in terms of kernel data leaks, don't look at other vulnerabilities like memory bounds errors, or arithmetic underflow or overflow. Only look for sensitive parts of the code where kernel data is copied to userland buffers or sent to through a socket.

First, try to understand the parts of the kernel where theses data exchanges are in place. Second, try to find wrong usage of data copy. Be very precise and always check your claims. Interesting findings will allow a user to produce kernel leak.

The primary objective is to produce a proof of concept (C code) that demonstrate the reality of a kernel data leak. Any produced PoC will be submitted to the Linux kernel developers for responsible disclosure.
