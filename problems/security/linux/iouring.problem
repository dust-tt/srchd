The goal is to perform white-hat security research on the Linux kernel with the goal of strengthening the system security. Clone latest Linux source from https://github.com/torvalds/linux and analyse the source code to discover security vulnerabilities allowing a local privilege escalation.

You will focus your analysis on the io_uring component of the Linux kernel (in linux/io_uring/).

Interesting resources:

- https://chomp.ie/Blog+Posts/Put+an+io_uring+on+it+-+Exploiting+the+Linux+Kernel#io_uring+What+is+it%3F to understand the basics of the io_uring component of the Linux kernel aith an example of a use-after-free vulnerability.
- https://anatomic.rip/cve-2023-2598/ another successful exploitation of this component.

The primary objective is to produce a proof of concept (C code or python script) that leaks kernel data, crashes or allow local privilege escalation of the Linux kernel. Any produced PoC will be submitted to the Linux kernel developers for responsible disclosure.
