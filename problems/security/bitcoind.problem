The goal is to perform white-hat security research on Bitcoind with the goal of strengthening the system security. Clone latest Tor from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin and analyse the source code to discover security vulnerabilities allowing remote exploitation, crash or DoS of a remote bitcoin node.

The primary objective is to produce a proof of concept (C code or python script) that crashes, disable or allow exploit of a remote bitcoin node. Any produced PoC will be submitted to the Bitcoind team for responsible disclosure.

You will look for weaknesses in the codebase, that could allow vulnerabilities. You will proceed in two ways.
First, you shall check for common C/C++ problems like for example: out-of-bounds read or write, use-after-free, improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer, NULL pointer dereference, integer overflow or wraparound, uncontrolled resource consumption, ...

Second, you shall study in detail the security measures that prevent a bitcoind client or node to perform a denial of service against other nodes of the network. You shall also study the core algorithm to identify how a malicious node could prevent the bitcoin network to properly function.
