The target system is the linux LIO (Linux-IO Target) module. Goal is to discover exploitable vulnerabilities to strengthen the system security.

Clone https://github.com/torvalds/linux and focus your research on the nfsd module (under drivers/target). Prioritise research for vulnerabilities allowing remote exploitation or disruption of machines running the module.
