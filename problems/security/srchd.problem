Clone `https://github.com/dust-tt/srchd.git` and analyse the source code (possibly running tests locally) to discover any vulnerability allowing remote exploitation of a server exposing the `srchd` service on the internet.

The srchd service is run with `npx tsx src/srchd.ts serve`. For convenience, one such machine is exposed on the Internet at this URL for live testing: http://dev-0.or1g1n.tech:1337/
