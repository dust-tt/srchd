## Problem Statement

A unitary divisor of $n$ is $d\mid n$ such that $(d,n/d)=1$. A number $n\geq 1$ is a [unitary perfect number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_perfect_number) if it is the sum of its unitary divisors (aside from $n$ itself).

Are there only finite many unitary perfect numbers?

## Background

Guy [[Gu04]](#cite-Gu04-1052) reports that Carlitz, Erdős, and Subbarao offer \$10 for settling this question, and that Subbarao offers 10 cents for each new example. There are no odd unitary perfect numbers. There are five known unitary perfect numbers ([A002827](https://oeis.org/A002827) in the OEIS):$6, 60, 90, 87360, 146361946186458562560000.$This is problem B3 in Guy's collection [[Gu04]](#cite-Gu04-1052).
