## Problem Statement

Let $X$ be a finite set of size $n$ and $H(n)$ be such that there is a function $f:P(X)\to X$ so that for every $Y\subseteq X$ with $\lvert Y\rvert \geq H(n)$ we have
$\{ f(A) : A\subseteq Y\}=X.$
Prove that
$H(n)-\log_2 n \to \infty.$

## Background

A problem of Erdős and Hajnal [[ErHa68]](javascript:void(0);) who proved that
$\log_2 n \leq H(n) &#60; \log_2n +(3+o(1))\log_2\log n.$
Erdős said that even the weaker statement that for $n=2^k$ we have $H(n)\geq k+1$ is open, but Alon has provided the following simple proof: by the pigeonhole principle there are $\frac{n-1}{2}$ subsets $A_i$ of size $2$ such that $f(A_i)$ is the same. Any set $Y$ of size $k$ containing at least $k/2$ of them can have at most $2^k-\lfloor k/2\rfloor+1&#60; 2^k=n$
distinct elements in the union of the images of $f(A)$ for $A\subseteq Y$. For this weaker statement, Erdős and Gy&#225;rf&#225;s conjecture the stronger form that if $\lvert X\rvert=2^k$ then, for any $f:P(X)\to X$, there must exist some $Y\subset X$ of size $k$ such that
$\#\{ f(A) : A\subseteq Y\}&#60; 2^k-k^C$
for every $C$ (with $k$ sufficiently large depending on $C$).

The condition that an integer `m` ensures the existence of a function `f` covering `Fin n`
for all large enough subsets `Y`.
The property is invariant under bijection, so we use a representative `Fin n` for a finite set
of size `n`.

Let $H(n)$ be the minimum integer $m$ such that there is a function $f: \mathcal{P}(X) \to X$
where $X$ is a finite set of size $n$, such that for every subset $Y \subseteq X$ with $|Y| \ge m$,
the set $\{f(A) : A \subseteq Y\}$ covers $X$.
