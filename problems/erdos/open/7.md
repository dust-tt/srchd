## Problem Statement

Is there a covering system all of whose moduli are odd?

## Background

Asked by Erdős and Selfridge (sometimes also with Schinzel). They also asked whether there can be a covering system such that all the moduli are odd and squarefree. The answer to this stronger question is no, proved by Balister, Bollob&#225;s, Morris, Sahasrabudhe, and Tiba [[BBMST22]](javascript:void(0);). Hough and Nielsen [[HoNi19]](javascript:void(0);) proved that at least one modulus must be divisible by either $2$ or $3$. A simpler proof of this fact was provided by Balister, Bollob&#225;s, Morris, Sahasrabudhe, and Tiba [[BBMST22]](javascript:void(0);). Selfridge has shown (as reported in [[Sc67]](javascript:void(0);)) that such a covering system exists if a covering system exists with moduli $n_1,\ldots,n_k$ such that no $n_i$ divides any other $n_j$ (but the latter has been shown not to exist, see [[586]](https://www.erdosproblems.com/586)).
