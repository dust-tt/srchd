## Definitions

The first three odd primes are an example of three consecutive primes.

There are 3 consecutive primes in arithmetic progression.

Let $k≥3$. Are there $k$ consecutive primes in arithmetic progression?

The existence of such progressions has been verified for $k≤10$.

Are there $11$ consecutive primes in arithmetic progression?

The set of arithmetic progressions of consecutive primes of length $k$.

It is open, even for $k=3$, whether there are infinitely many such progressions.

Fix a $k \geq 3$. Is it true that there are infinitely many arithmetic prime progressions of length $k$?

## Problem Statement

The predicate that a set `s` consists of `l` consecutive primes (possibly infinite).
This predicate does not assert a specific value for the first term.
