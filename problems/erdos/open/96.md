## Problem Statement

If $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ form a convex polygon then there are $O(n)$ many pairs which are distance $1$ apart.

## Background

Conjectured by Erdős and Moser. In [[Er92e]](#cite-Er92e-96) Erdős credits the conjecture that the true upper bound is $2n$ to himself and Fishburn. Füredi [[Fu90]](#cite-Fu90-96) proved an upper bound of $O(n\log n)$. A short proof of this bound was given by Brass and Pach [[BrPa01]](#cite-BrPa01-96). The best known upper bound is$\leq n\log_2n+4n,$due to Aggarwal [[Ag15]](#cite-Ag15-96).

Edelsbrunner and Hajnal [[EdHa91]](#cite-EdHa91-96) have constructed $n$ such points with $2n-7$ pairs distance $1$ apart. (This disproved an early stronger conjecture of Erdős and Moser, that the true answer was $\frac{5}{3}n+O(1)$.)

A positive answer would follow from [[97]](/97). See also [[90]](/90).

In [[Er92e]](#cite-Er92e-96) Erdős makes the stronger conjecture that, if $g(x)$ counts the largest number of points equidistant from $x$ in $A$, then$\sum_{x\in A}g(x)< 4n.$He notes that the example of Edelsbrunner and Hajnal shows that $\sum_{x\in A}g(x)>4n-O(1)$ is possible.
