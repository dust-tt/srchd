## Definitions

Is there a polynomial $f:\mathbb{Z}\to \mathbb{Z}$ of degree at least $2$ and a set
$A\subset \mathbb{Z}$ such that for any $z\in \mathbb{Z}$ there is exactly one $a\in A$ and
$b\in \{ f(n) : n\in\mathbb{Z}\}$ such that $z=a+b$?

There is no such $A$ for the polynomial $f(x) = X^2$.

This is shown in [Sek59].

There is no such $A$ for any polynomial $f(x) = aX^2 + bX + c$, if $a | b$
with $a \ne 0$ and $b \ne 0.
This was found be AlphaProof for the specific instance $X^2 - X + 1$ and then generalised.

Probably there is no such $A$ for the polynomial $X^3$.

Probably there is no such $A$ for the polynomial $X^k$ for any $k \ge 2$. This is asked in [Sek59].
