## Definitions

Does there exist a minimal basis $A \subset \mathbb{N}$ with positive density
such that, for any $n \in A$, the (upper) density of integers which
cannot be represented without using $n$ is positive?

## Problem Statement

`Rep A m h` means `m` is a sum of at most `h` elements of `A`x.
