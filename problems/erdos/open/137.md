## Definitions

Erdős [Er82c] conjectures that, if $k$ is fixed, then for all $n$ sufficiently large and all
positive integers $m$, there must be at least $k$ distinct primes $p$ such that
$p\mid m(m+1)\cdots (m+n)$ and yet $p^2$ does not divide the right hand side.

## Problem Statement

Let $k\geq 3$. Can the product of any $k$ consecutive integers $N$ ever be powerful? That is,
must there always exist a prime $p\mid N$ such that $p^2\nmid N$?

## Variants and Related Results

Let $k\geq 2$. Erdős and Selfridge [ES75] proved that the product of any $k$ consecutive
integers $N$ cannot be a perfect power.
