## Definitions

This set contains all solutions `(m, P)` to the Erdős problem 313.
A solution is a pair where `m` is an integer `≥ 2` and `P` is a non-empty, finite set of
distinct prime numbers, such that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes in `P` equals `1 - 1/m`.

Are there infinitely many pairs `(m, P)` where `m ≥ 2` is an integer
and `P` is a set of distinct primes such that the following equation holds:
$\sum_{p \in P} \frac{1}{p} = 1 - \frac{1}{m}$?

An integer `n` is a **primary pseudoperfect number** if it is the denominator `m` in a
solution `(m, P)` to the Erdős 313 problem.

It is conjectured that the set of primary pseudoperfect numbers is infinite.

There are at least 8 primary pseudoperfect numbers.
