## Definitions

A variant asking for explicit bounds on how large N needs to be in terms of M.

This version provides a constructive function f such that for all M ≥ 1 and N ≥ f(M),
every maximal Sidon set A ⊆ {1,…,N} has another Sidon set B ⊆ {1,…,N} of size M with
disjoint difference sets (apart from 0).

The set `{1, 2, 4}` is a maximal Sidon set in `{1, ..., 4}`.

The difference set of `{1, 2, 4}` is `{0, 1, 2, 3}`.

For any maximal Sidon set, the difference set contains 0.

## Problem Statement

**Erdős Problem 42**: Let M ≥ 1 and N be sufficiently large in terms of M. Is it true that for every
maximal Sidon set `A ⊆ {1,…,N}` there is another Sidon set `B ⊆ {1,…,N}` of size M such that
`(A - A) ∩ (B - B) = {0}`?
