## Definitions

Sanity Check: the trivial ruler is actually a perfect ruler if $K \geq N$

The problem is to determine the limit of the sequence $\frac{F(N)}{\sqrt{N}}$ as $N \to \infty$.

A known lower bound to the limit by Leech [Le56], which is $1.56\dots$. -/
noncomputable abbrev lower_bound := √(sSup {2 * (1 - Real.sin θ / θ) | θ ≠ 0})
/-- A known upper bound obtained by constructing Wichmann's Rulers [Wi63]. -/
noncomputable abbrev upper_bound := √3

/-- The existence of the limit has been proved by Erdős and Gál [ErGa48].
The lower bound has been proven by Leech [Le56], who refined an argument of Rédei and Rényi.
The upper bound is due to Wichmann [Wi63].

## Problem Statement

An $N$-perfect ruler is a finite subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ (the marks), such that each
positive integer $k \leq N$ can be measured, that is, expressed as a difference $k = a_1 - a_0$
with $a_0, a_1 \in A$. The set $A$ is then also called a difference basis w.r.t. $N$.

## Notes
