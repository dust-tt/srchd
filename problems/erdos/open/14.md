## Definitions

The number of integers in $\{1,\ldots,N\}$ which are not representable in exactly one way
as the sum of two elements from $A$ (either because they are not representable at all, or
because they are representable in more than one way).

Let $A ⊆ \mathbb{N}$. Let $B ⊆ \mathbb{N}$ be the set of integers which are representable
in exactly one way as the sum of two elements from $A$. Is it true that for all
$\epsilon > 0$ and large $N$, $|\{1,\ldots,N\} \setminus B| \gg_\epsilon N^{1/2 - \epsilon}$?

Is it possible that $|\{1,\ldots,N\} \setminus B| = o(N^\frac{1}{2})$?

## Problem Statement

Let $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$. Let $B\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ be the set of integers which are representable in exactly one way as the sum of two elements from $A$. Is it true that for all $\epsilon&#62;0$ and large $N$
$\lvert \{1,\ldots,N\}\backslash B\rvert \gg_\epsilon N^{1/2-\epsilon}.$

## Background

Asked by Erdős, S&#225;rk&#246;zy, and Szemer&#233;di, who constructed an $A$ such that for all $\epsilon&#62;0$ and all large $N$
$\lvert \{1,\ldots,N\}\backslash B\rvert \ll_\epsilon N^{1/2+\epsilon},$
and yet there for all $\epsilon&#62;0$ there exist infinitely many $N$ where
$\lvert \{1,\ldots,N\}\backslash B\rvert \gg_\epsilon N^{1/3-\epsilon}.$ Erd&#246;s and Freud investigated the finite analogue in 'a recent Hungarian paper', proving that there exists $A\subseteq \{1,\ldots,N\}$ such that the number of integers not representable in exactly one way as the sum of two elements from $A$ is $&#60;2^{3/2}N^{1/2}$, and suggest the constant $2^{3/2}$ is perhaps best possible.
