## Problem Statement

Can every triangle-free graph on $5n$ vertices be made bipartite by deleting at most $n^2$ edges?

## Background

The blow-up of $C_5$ shows that this would be the best possible. The best known bound is due to Balogh, Clemen, and Lidicky [[BCL21]](#cite-BCL21-23), who proved that deleting at most $1.064n^2$ edges suffices.

In [[Er92b]](#cite-Er92b-23) Erdős asks, more generally, if a graph on $(2k+1)n$ vertices in which every odd cycle has size $\geq 2k+1$ can be made bipartite by deleting at most $n^2$ edges.
