## Definitions

Let $f(1) = f(2) = 1$ and for $n > 2$
$$
f(n) = f(n - f(n - 1)) + f(n - f(n - 2)).
$$

Note: It is not known whether $f(n)$ is well-defined for all $n$.

partial def f : ℕ+ → ℕ+
  | 1 => 1
  | 2 => 1
  | n => f (n - f (n - 1)) + f (n - f (n - 2))

/--
Does $f(n)$ miss infinitely many integers?
