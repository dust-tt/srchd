## Problem Statement

Given $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$, no five of which are on a line, the number of lines containing four points is $o(n^2)$.

## Background

There are examples of sets of $n$ points with $\sim n^2/6$ many collinear triples and no four points on a line. Such constructions are given by Burr, Grünbaum, and Sloane [[BGS74]](#cite-BGS74-101) and Füredi and Palásti [[FuPa84]](#cite-FuPa84-101). 

Grünbaum [[Gr76]](#cite-Gr76-101) constructed an example with $\gg n^{3/2}$ such lines. Erdős speculated this may be the correct order of magnitude. This is false: Solymosi and Stojaković [[SoSt13]](#cite-SoSt13-101) have constructed a set with no five on a line and at least$n^{2-O(1/\sqrt{\log n})}$many lines containing exactly four points.
