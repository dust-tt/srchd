## Problem Statement

Let $A\subset\mathbb{N}$ be such that every large integer can be written as $n^2+a$ for some $a\in A$ and $n\geq 0$. What is the smallest possible value of 
$\limsup \frac{\lvert A\cap\{1,\ldots,N\}\rvert}{N^{1/2}}?$

## Background

Erdős observed that this value is finite and $&#62;1$.

## Variants and Related Results

Erdos observed that this value is finite and > 1.

The smallest possible value of `lim sup n → ∞ |A ∩ {1, …, N}| / N^(1/2) = 0`
is at most `2φ^(5/2) ≈ 6.66`, with `φ` equal to the golden ratio. Proven by
Wouter van Doorn.
