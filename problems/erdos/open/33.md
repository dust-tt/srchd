## Definitions

Let `A ⊆ ℕ` be a set such that every integer can be written as `n^2 + a` for some `a` in `A`
and `n ≥ 0`. -/
-- Formalisation note: Changed 'every large integer' to 'every integer' as for the statement these
-- conditions are equivalent. Also, this was the formulation in the original paper `by Erdos.
def AdditiveBasisCondition (A : Set ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∀ (k : ℕ), ∃ (n : ℕ) (a : ℕ), a ∈ A ∧ k = a + n^2

/-- Let `A ⊆ ℕ` be a set such that every integer can be written as `n^2 + a`
for some `a` in `A` and `n ≥ 0`. What is the smallest possible value of
`lim sup n → ∞ |A ∩ {1, …, N}| / N^(1/2) = 0`?

## Problem Statement

*Problem statement not available locally. See [erdosproblems.com/33](https://www.erdosproblems.com/33) for details.*

## Variants and Related Results

Erdos observed that this value is finite and > 1.

The smallest possible value of `lim sup n → ∞ |A ∩ {1, …, N}| / N^(1/2) = 0`
is at most `2φ^(5/2) ≈ 6.66`, with `φ` equal to the golden ratio. Proven by
Wouter van Doorn.
