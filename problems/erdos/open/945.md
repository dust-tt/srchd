## Definitions

Let $F(x)$ be the maximal $k$ such that there exist $n+1, \dots, n+k \le x$
with $τ(n+1), \dots, τ(n+k)$ all distinct, where $τ(m)$ counts the divisors of $m$.-/
noncomputable def F (x : ℝ) : ℕ :=
  sSup {k | ∃ (n : ℕ), n + k ≤ x ∧ (Set.Ioc n (n + k)).InjOn τ}

-- Implementation note: we define a Prop here and below to be able to easily formulate
-- the equivalence between the two variants. Because the theorems require `answer(sorry)` we
-- can't handle this with `type_of%`.
def Erdos945Prop : Prop := ∃ O : ℝ → ℝ, O =O[atTop] (1 : ℝ → ℝ) ∧ ∀ᶠ x in atTop, F x ≤ log x ^ O x

/--
Is it true that $F(x) \leq (\log x)^{O(1)}$?

The two ways of phrasing the conjecture are equivalent.

## Variants and Related Results

Is there a constant $C > 0$ such that, for all large $x$, every interval $[x, x+(\log x)C]$
contains two integers with the same number of divisors?

Erdős and Mirsky [ErMi52] proved that $\frac{(\log x)^{1/2}}{\log\log x}\ll F(x)$.

Erdős and Mirsky [ErMi52] proved that $\log F(x) \ll  \frac{(\log x)^{1/2}}$.
