## Definitions

Let $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ and $D(A)$ be the set of those numbers which occur infinitely often as
$a_1 - a_2$ with $a_1, a_2\in A$. What conditions on $A$ are sufficient to ensure $D(A)$ has bounded
gaps?

This is formalised here using the `answer(sorry)` mechanism. In order to solve this problem one
has to provide what the sufficient conditions are, and proof that they imply the desired condition.
If the condition is a solution to the problem is up to human judgement.

## Problem Statement

The set of numbers $D(A)$ which occur infinitely often as $a_1 - a_2$ with $a_1, a_2 \in A$.
-/
noncomputable def D_A (A : Set ℕ) : Set ℤ :=
  { d : ℤ | Set.Infinite { (a, b) : ℕ × ℕ | a ∈ A ∧ b ∈ A ∧ (a : ℤ) - (b : ℤ) = d } }

/--
A set $S \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$ has bounded gaps if it is syndetic, meaning there is a uniform
bound $M$ such that every interval of length $M$ contains an element of $S$.
