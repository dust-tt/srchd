## Problem Statement

We call $m$ practical if every integer $n&#60;m$ is the sum of distinct divisors of $m$. If $m$ is practical then let $h(m)$  be such that $h(m)$ many divisors always suffice.

Are there infinitely many practical $m$ such that$h(m) &#60; (\log\log m)^{O(1)}?$Is it true that $h(n!)&#60;n^{o(1)}$? Or perhaps even $h(n!)&#60;(\log n)^{O(1)}$?

## Background

It is easy to see that almost all numbers are not practical. Erdős originally showed that $h(n!) <n$. Vose [[Vo85]](#cite-Vo85-18) proved the existence of infinitely many practical $m$ such that $h(m)\ll (\log m)^{1/2}$. 

The sequence of practical numbers is [A005153](https://oeis.org/A005153) in the OEIS.

The reward of \$250 is offered in [[Er81h]](#cite-Er81h-18), apparently (although this is not entirely clear) for a proof or disproof of whether$h(n!) <(\log n)^{O(1)}.$See also [[304]](/304) and [[825]](/825).
