## Definitions

A proper unitary divisor of $n$ is a divisor $d$ of $n$
such that $d$ is coprime to $n/d$, and $d < n$.

A number $n > 0$ is a unitary perfect number if it is the sum of its proper unitary divisors.

Are there only finitely many unitary perfect numbers?

All unitary perfect numbers are even.
