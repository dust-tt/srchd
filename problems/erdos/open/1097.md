## Definitions

The main conjecture: for any finite set of integers $A$ with $|A| = n$, the number of distinct
common differences in three-term arithmetic progressions is $O(n^{3/2})$.

## Problem Statement

Given a finite set of integers `A` (modelled as a `Finset ℤ`), the set
`CommonDifferencesThreeTermAP A` consists of all integers `d` such that there
is a non-trivial three-term arithmetic progression `a, b, c ∈ A` with
`b - a = d` and `c - b = d`.

## Variants and Related Results

A weaker bound has been proven: there are always at most $n^2$ such values of $d$.

A trivial lower bound: there exist sets $A$ with $|A| = n$ that contain at least $\Omega(n)$
distinct common differences of three-term arithmetic progressions.
