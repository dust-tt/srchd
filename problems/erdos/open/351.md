## Definitions

The set of rational numbers of the form `P(n) + 1 / n` where `n` is a natural number
and `P` is a polynomial with rational coefficients.

Note: We include `P 0` in there (since `1 / 0 = 0`), but this doesn't change the validity of the
conjecture

The predicate that a set `A` is strongly complete, i.e. that for every finite set `B`, every sufficiently
large integer is a sum of elements of the set `A \ B`.

Let $p(x) \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ be a non-constant rational polynomial with positive leading
coefficient. Is it true that \[A=\{ p(n)+1/n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}\] is strongly complete,
in the sense that, for any finite set $B$,
\[\left\{\sum_{a \in X} a : X \subseteq A \setminus B, X \textrm{ is finite}\right\}\]
contains all sufficiently large integers?

## Problem Statement

The predicate that the rational polynomial `P` has a complete image.

## Variants and Related Results

Let $p(x) = x \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$. It has been shown that
\[A=\{ p(n)+1/n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}\]
is strongly complete, in the sense that, for any finite set $B$,
\[\left\{\sum_{a \in X} a : X \subseteq A \setminus B, X \textrm{ is finite}\right\}\]
contains all sufficiently large integers.

/-- Let $p(x) = x ^ 2 \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$. It has been shown that
\[A=\{ p(n)+1/n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}\]
is strongly complete, in the sense that, for any finite set $B$,
\[\left\{\sum_{a \in X} a : X \subseteq A \setminus B, X \textrm{ is finite}\right\}\]
contains all sufficiently large integers.
