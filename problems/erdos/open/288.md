## Definitions

Is it true that there are only finitely many pairs of intervals $I_1$, $I_2$ such that
$$
\sum_{n_1 \in I_1} \frac{1}{n_1} + \sum_{n_2 \in I_2} \frac{1}{n_2} \in \mathbb{N}?
$$

## Problem Statement

*Problem statement not available locally. See [erdosproblems.com/288](https://www.erdosproblems.com/288) for details.*

## Variants and Related Results

This is still open even if $|I_2| = 1$.

It is perhaps true with two intervals replaced by any $k$ intervals.

Is it true for any $k > 2$ that only finitely many $k$ intervals satisfy this condition?
