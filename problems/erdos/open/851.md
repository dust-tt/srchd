## Definitions

Let $\epsilon > 0$. Is there some $r \ll_\epsilon 1$ such that the density of integers of the
form $2^k+n$, where $k \geq 0$ and $n$ has at most $r$ prime divisors, is at least $1-\epsilon$?

## Problem Statement

`TwoPowAddSet r` is the set of integers of the form `2^k+n`, where `k ≥ 0` and `n` has at most `r`
prime divisors.

## Variants and Related Results

The set of integers of the form `2^k+p` (where `p` is prime) has positive lower density.

Formalisation note: here we also allow `p = 1` since this simplifies the code and is equivalent
to the original statement.
