## Problem Statement

Let $3\leq d_1 < d_2 < \cdots < d_k$ be integers such that
$$\sum_{1\leq i\leq k}\frac{1}{d_i-1}\geq 1.$$
Can all sufficiently large integers be written as a sum of the shape $\sum_i c_ia_i$
where $c_i\in \{0, 1\}$ and $a_i$ has only the digits $0, 1$ when written in base $d_i$?
