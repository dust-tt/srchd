A question of Erd\H{o}s and Hajnal [ErHa68b], who proved that for every finite $k$
there is a graph with chromatic number $\aleph_1$ and $\aleph_k$ vertices where each subgraph on
less than $\aleph_k$ vertices has chromatic number $\leq \aleph_0$. -/
-- Formalisation note: the source is missing the assumption that the graph have ℵₖ vertices
-- which can be found in [ErHa68b]

/-- In [ErHa69] the questions are stated with $= \aleph_0$ rather than $\leq\aleph_0$. This is
a likely typo since it can be shown that no such graph exists in this case.

This is the first question with induced subgraphs.
