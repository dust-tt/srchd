## Definitions

We say that `c` is admissible if for any finit set `A` such that for any subset `B` of size `4`,
`(B - B).card = 11`, there exists a Sidon subset `S` of size at least `c * A.ncard`.

What is the supremum of the set of admissible numbers?

The supremum is strictly larger than `1 / 2`, which is proved in [GyLe95].

In [GyLe95], the authors also prove that the supremum is smaller than `3 / 5`.
