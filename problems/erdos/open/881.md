## Definitions

A *minimal* additive basis of order `k` is a set `A` such that
* `A` is an asymptotic additive basis of order `k`, and
* for every infinite subset `B ⊆ A`, the complement `A \ B` is *not*
  an asymptotic additive basis of order `k`.

**Erdős Problem 881.**

Let `A ⊂ ℕ` be an additive basis of order `k` which is minimal in the sense that
if `B ⊂ A` is any infinite set, then `A \ B` is not a basis of order `k`.

Must there exist an infinite `B ⊂ A` such that `A \ B`
is an additive basis of order `k + 1`?
