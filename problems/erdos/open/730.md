## Definitions

Are there infinitely many pairs of integers $n < m$ such that $\binom{2n}{n}$
and $\binom{2m}{m}$ have the same set of prime divisors?

## Problem Statement

*Problem statement not available locally. See [erdosproblems.com/730](https://www.erdosproblems.com/730) for details.*

## Variants and Related Results

For example, $(87,88)$ and $(607,608)$ are such pairs.

Show that for all $n$, the binomial coefficient $\binom{2n}{n}$ is even.

There are examples where $(n, m) ∈ S$ with $m ≠ n + 1$.
