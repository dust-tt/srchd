## Problem Statement

Let $h(n)$ be such that any $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$, with no three on a line and no four on a circle, determine at least $h(n)$ distinct distances. Does $h(n)/n\to \infty$?

## Background

Erdős could not even prove $h(n)\geq n$. Pach has shown $h(n)&#60;n^{\log_23}$. Erdős, F&#252;redi, and Pach [[EFPR93]](javascript:void(0);) have improved this to 
$h(n) &#60; n\exp(c\sqrt{\log n})$
for some constant $c&#62;0$.
