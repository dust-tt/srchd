Let $s_1 < s_2 < \dots$ be the sequence of squarefree numbers. Is it true that
for any $\epsilon > 0$ and large $n$, $s_{n+1} - s_n \ll_\epsilon s_n^\epsilon$?

Let $s_1 < s_2 < \dots$ be the sequence of squarefree numbers. Is it true that
$s_{n + 1} - s_n \le (1 + o(1)) \cdot (\pi^2 / 6) \cdot \log (s_n) / \log (\log (s_n))$?

## Variants and Related Results

In [Er79] Erdős says perhaps $s_{n+1} - s_n \ll \log s_n$, but he is 'very doubtful'.
