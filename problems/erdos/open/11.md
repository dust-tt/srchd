## Problem Statement

Is every odd $n$ the sum of a squarefree number and a power of 2?

## Background

Odlyzko has checked this up to $10^7$. Granville and Soundararajan [[GrSo98]](javascript:void(0);) have proved that this is very related to the problem of finding primes $p$ for which $2^p\equiv 2\pmod{p^2}$ (for example this conjecture implies there are infinitely many such $p$). This is equivalent to asking whether every $n$ not divisible by $4$ is the sum of a squarefree number and a power of two. Erdős thought that proving this with two powers of 2 is perhaps easy, and could prove that it is true (with a single power of two) for almost all $n$. See also [[9]](https://www.erdosproblems.com/9), [[10]](https://www.erdosproblems.com/10), and [[16]](https://www.erdosproblems.com/16).

## Variants and Related Results

Erdős often asked this under the weaker assumption that $n > 1$
is not divisible by 4.

Is every odd $n > 1$ the sum of a squarefree number and two powers of 2?

Every odd $1 < n < 10^7$ is the sum of a squarefree number and a power of 2.

Every odd $1 < n < 2^50$ is the sum of a squarefree number and a power of 2.

Suppose that every odd $n$ is the sum of a squarefree number and a power of 2. Then the set of primes
$p$ such that $2 ^ p ≡ 2 \mod p ^ 2$ is infinite. This is Theorem 1 in [GrSo98].
