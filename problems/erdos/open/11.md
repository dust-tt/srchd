## Variants and Related Results

Erdős often asked this under the weaker assumption that $n > 1$
is not divisible by 4.

Is every odd $n > 1$ the sum of a squarefree number and two powers of 2?

Every odd $1 < n < 10^7$ is the sum of a squarefree number and a power of 2.

Every odd $1 < n < 2^50$ is the sum of a squarefree number and a power of 2.

Suppose that every odd $n$ is the sum of a squarefree number and a power of 2. Then the set of primes
$p$ such that $2 ^ p ≡ 2 \mod p ^ 2$ is infinite. This is Theorem 1 in [GrSo98].
