## Definitions

What is the infimum of `|{x ∈ ℝ : |f x| < 1}|` over all nonconstant monic polynomials `f` such
that all of its roots are real and contained in `[-1,1]`?

The infimum of `|{x ∈ ℝ : |f x| < 1}|` over all nonconstant monic polynomials `f` such that
all of its roots are real and contained in `[-1,1]` is `< 1.835`.

The infimum of `|{x ∈ ℝ : |f x| < 1}|` over all nonconstant monic polynomials `f` such that
all of its roots are real and contained in `[-1,1]` is `≥ 2 ^ (4 / 3) - 1`.

The supremum of `|{x ∈ ℝ : |f x| < 1}|` over all monic polynomials `f` such that
all of its roots are real and contained in `[-1,1]` is  `2 * 2 ^ (1 / 2)`. This is proved in
[Tao25].
