## Variants and Related Results

Erdős [Er76d] conjectured a stronger statement: if $n_k$ is the $k$th powerful number,
then $n_{k+2} - n_k > n_k^c$ for some constant $c > 0$.

There is no quadruple of powerful numbers, since at least one of the four numbers must be
$2 \pmod{4}$, which cannot be powerful (since $2$ divides it, but $2^2$ does not).
