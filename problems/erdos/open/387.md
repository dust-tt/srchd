## Definitions

Is there an absolute constant `c > 0` such that, for all `1 ≤ k < n`, the binomial coefficient
`n.choose k` has a divisor in `(cn, n]`?

The following is Schinzel's conjecture, which appears in [Gu04].

It is easy to see that `n.choose k` has a divisor in `[n / k, n]`.

Is it true for any `c < 1` and all `n` sufficiently large, for all `1 ≤ k < n`, `n.choose k`
has a divisor in `(cn, n]`? This is a variant of `erdos_387` and appears in [Gu04].
