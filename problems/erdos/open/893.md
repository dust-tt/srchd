## Definitions

Definition of function $f(n) := \sum_{1\leq k\leq n}\tau(2^k-1)$.
Here $\tau$ is the divisor counting function, which is `σ 0` in mathlib.

Does the limit $\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{f(2n)}{f(n)}$ tend to infinity?

(Other finite limits have been ruled out by [KoLu25], see below)

## Problem Statement

*Problem statement not available locally. See [erdosproblems.com/893](https://www.erdosproblems.com/893) for details.*

## Variants and Related Results

Kovač and Luca [KoLu25] (building on a heuristic independently found by
Cambie (personal communication)) have shown that there is no finite limit, in that
$\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{f(2n)}{f(n)}$ is unbounded.
