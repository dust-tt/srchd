## Definitions

Defines the set of new numbers generated from a set A by the operation
$x y - 1$ for $x \neq y$.

The sequence of sets $A_n$ where $A_0 = \{2, 3\}$ and $A_{n+1}$ is $A_n$ union all newly
generated elements.

The set of integers which eventually appear in the sequence, which is the union of all $A_n$.

Let $a_1 = 2$ and $a_2 = 3$ and continue the sequence by appending to $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ all possible
values of $a_i a_j - 1$ with $i \neq j$.
Is it true that the set of integers which eventually appear has positive density?
