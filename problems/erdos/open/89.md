## Problem Statement

Does every set of $n$ distinct points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ determine $\gg n/\sqrt{\log n}$ many distinct distances?

## Background

A $\sqrt{n}\times\sqrt{n}$ integer grid shows that this would be the best possible. Nearly solved by Guth and Katz [[GuKa15]](javascript:void(0);) who proved that there are always $\gg n/\log n$ many distinct distances. A stronger form (see [[604]](https://www.erdosproblems.com/604)) may be true: is there a single point which determines $\gg n/\sqrt{\log n}$ distinct distances, or even $\gg n$ many such points, or even that this is true averaged over all points. See also [[661]](https://www.erdosproblems.com/661).

## Variants and Related Results

Guth and Katz [GuKa15] proved that there are always $\gg \frac{n}{\log n}$ many distinct distances.

This theorem provides a sanity check, showing that the main conjecture (`erdos_89`) is strictly
stronger than the solved Guth and Katz result. It proves that, trivially, if the lower bound
$\frac{n}{\sqrt{\log n}}$ holds, then the weaker lower bound $\frac{n}{\log n}$ must also hold.
