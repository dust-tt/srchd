## Problem Statement

The minimum number of distinct distances guaranteed for any set of $n$ points.
-/
noncomputable def minimalDistinctDistances (n : ℕ) : ℕ :=
  sInf {(distinctDistances points : ℝ) | (points : Finset ℝ²) (_ : points.card = n)}

/--
Does every set of $n$ distinct points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ determine $\gg \frac{n}{\sqrt{\log n}}$
many distinct distances?

## Variants and Related Results

Guth and Katz [GuKa15] proved that there are always $\gg \frac{n}{\log n}$ many distinct distances.

[GuKa15] Guth, Larry and Katz, Nets Hawk, On the Erdős distinct distances problem in the plane. Ann. of Math. (2) (2015), 155-190.

This theorem provides a sanity check, showing that the main conjecture (`erdos_89`) is strictly
stronger than the solved Guth and Katz result. It proves that, trivially, if the lower bound
$\frac{n}{\sqrt{\log n}}$ holds, then the weaker lower bound $\frac{n}{\log n}$ must also hold.
