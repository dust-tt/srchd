## Problem Statement

Let $\epsilon &#62;0$. Is it true that, if $k$ is sufficiently large, then
$R(G)&#62;(1-\epsilon)^kR(k)$
for every graph $G$ with chromatic number $\chi(G)=k$? 

Even stronger, is there some $c&#62;0$ such that, for all large $k$, $R(G)&#62;cR(k)$ for every graph $G$ with chromatic number $\chi(G)=k$?

## Background

Erdős originally conjectured that $R(G)\geq R(k)$, which is trivial for $k=3$, but fails already for $k=4$, as Faudree and McKay [[FaMc93]](javascript:void(0);) showed that $R(W)=17$ for the pentagonal wheel $W$.

Since $R(k)\leq 4^k$ this is trivial for $\epsilon\geq 3/4$. Yuval Wigderson points out that $R(G)\gg 2^{k/2}$ for any $G$ with chromatic number $k$ (via a random colouring), which asymptotically matches the best-known lower bounds for $R(k)$.
