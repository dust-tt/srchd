## Definitions

If there is a finite projective plane of order $n$ then must $n$ be a prime power?

These always exist if $n$ is a prime power.

This conjecture has been proved for $n \leq 11$.

It is open whether there exists a projective plane of order 12.

Bruck and Ryser have proved that if $n \equiv 1 (\mod 4)$ or $n \equiv 2 (\mod 4)$ then $n$ must be
the sum of two squares.
