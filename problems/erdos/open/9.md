## Definitions

The set is known to be infinite. In [Er77c] Erdős credits Schinzel with proving that there are
infinitely many odd integers not of this form, but gives no reference.

## Problem Statement

Let $A$ be the set of all integers not of the form $p+2^{k}+2^l$ (where $k,l\geq 0$ and $p$ is prime). Is the upper density of $A$ positive?

## Background

Crocker [[Cr71]](javascript:void(0);) has proved there are are $\gg\log\log N$ such integers in $\{1,\ldots,N\}$ (any number of the form $2^{2^m}-1$ with $m\geq 3$ suffices). Pan [[Pa11]](javascript:void(0);) improved this to $\gg_\epsilon N^{1-\epsilon}$ for any $\epsilon&#62;0$. Erdős believes this cannot be proved by covering systems, i.e. integers of the form $p+2^k+2^l$ exist in every infinite arithmetic progression.
