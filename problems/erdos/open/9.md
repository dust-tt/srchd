## Definitions

The set is known to be infinite. In [Er77c] Erdős credits Schinzel with proving that there are
infinitely many odd integers not of this form, but gives no reference.

## Problem Statement

Is the upper density of the set of odd numbers that cannot be expressed as a prime plus
two powers of 2 positive?
