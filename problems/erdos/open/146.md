## Problem Statement

If $H$ is bipartite and is $r$-degenerate, that is, every induced subgraph of $H$ has minimum degree $\leq r$, then$\mathrm{ex}(n;H) \ll n^{2-1/r}.$

## Background

Conjectured by Erdős and Simonovits  [[ErSi84]](#cite-ErSi84-146). Open even for $r=2$. Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov [[AKS03]](#cite-AKS03-146) have proved$\mathrm{ex}(n;H) \ll n^{2-1/4r}.$They also prove the full Erdős-Simonovits conjectured bound if $H$ is bipartite and the maximum degree in one side of the bipartition is $r$.
