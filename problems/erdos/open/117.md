## Problem Statement

Let $h(n)$ be minimal such that any group $G$ with the property that any subset of $&#62;n$ elements contains some $x\neq y$ such that $xy=yx$ can be covered by at most $h(n)$ many Abelian subgroups.

Estimate $h(n)$ as well as possible.

## Background

Pyber [[Py87]](javascript:void(0);) has proved there exist constants $c_2&#62;c_1&#62;1$ such that $c_1^n&#60;h(n)&#60;c_2^n$. Erdős [[Er97f]](javascript:void(0);) writes that the lower bound was already known to Isaacs.
