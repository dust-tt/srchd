## Definitions

Let $n \geq 4$. Are there $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$, no three on a line and no four on a circle,
such that all pairwise distances are integers?

## Problem Statement

The predicate (on $n$) that there exist $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$,
no three on a line and no four on a circle,
such that all pairwise distances are integers.

## Variants and Related Results

The best construction to date, due to Kreisel and Kurz, has $n = 7$.
