## Definitions

The number of ways in which a natural `n` can be written as the sum of
`o` members of the set `A`. -/
noncomputable

  { a : Fin o → ℕ | Set.range a ⊆ A ∧ ∑ i, a i = n }.ncard

/-- Let $A$ be an additive basis of order $2$, let $f(n)$ denote the number of ways in which
$n$ can be written as the sum of two elements from $A$. If $f(n) \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$, then
must $A$ contain a minimal additive basis of order $2$?

Let $A$ be an additive basis of order $2$, let $f(n)$ denote the number of ways in which
$n$ can be written as the sum of two elements from $A$. If $f(n) > \epsilon \log n$ for large $n$
and an arbitrary fixed $\epsilon > 0$, then must $A$ contain a minimal additive
basis of order $2$?

## Variants and Related Results

Erdős and Nathanson proved that this is true if $f(n) > (\log \frac{4}{3})^{-1} \log n$ for
all large $n$.

Härtter and Nathanson proved that there exist additive bases which do not contain
any minimal additive bases.
