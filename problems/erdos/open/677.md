## Definitions

Erdős expected very few solutions for $M(n, k) = M(m, l)$, where $m \geq n + k$ and $l > 1$.
The only solutions he knew were the following.

Denote by $M(n, k)$ the least common multiple of the finite set $\{n+1, \dotsc, n+k\}$.
Is it true that for all $m \geq n + k$, we get $M(m, k) \neq M(n, k)$?
