## Definitions

Show that the equation `n!=a_1!a_2!···a_k!`, with `n−1 > a_1 ≥ a_2 ≥ ··· ≥ a_k`, has
only finitely many solutions.

## Problem Statement

Let `S` be the set of non-trivial solutions to the equation `n! = a₁! ··· aₖ!`
such that `a₁ ≥ ... ≥ aₖ` and `n-1 > a₁`.

## Variants and Related Results

Show that if `P(n(n+1)) / log n → ∞` where `P(m)` denotes the largest prime factor of `m`, then
the equation `n!=a_1!a_2!···a_k!`, with `n−1 > a_1 ≥ a_2 ≥ ··· ≥ a_k`, has only
finitely many solutions.

Show that if `P(n(n−1)) > 4 log n` for large enough `n`, where `P(m)` denotes the
largest prime factor of `m`, then the equation `n!=a_1!a_2!···a_k!`, with
`n−1 > a_1 ≥ a_2 ≥ ··· ≥ a_k`, has only finitely many solutions.

Hickerson conjectured the largest solution the equation `n!=a_1!a_2!···a_k!`, with
`n−1 > a_1 ≥ a_2 ≥ ··· ≥ a_k`, is `16!=14!5!2!`.

Surányi was the first to conjecture that the only non-trivial solution to `a!b!=n!`
is `6!7!=10!`.
