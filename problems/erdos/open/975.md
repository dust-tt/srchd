## Definitions

Sum of $\tau(f(n))$ from `0` to `⌊x⌋` for a polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Z}[X]$.

Here $\tau$ is the divisor counting function, which is `σ 0` in mathlib.
Also, for simplicity, we use `Nat.floor` to convert rational values to natural numbers, instead of
dealing with negative values. -/

/--
For an irreducible polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ with $f(n) \ge 1$ for sufficiently large $n$,
does there exists a constant $c = c(f) > 0$ such that
$\sum_{n \le x} \tau(f(n)) \approx c \cdot x \log x$?

Note that it is unclear whether the polynomial should have integer coefficients or merely be
integer-valued. We assume the former.

The correctness of the growth rate is shown in [Va39] (lower bound) and [Er52b] (upper bound).

When $f$ is an irreducible quadratic polynomial, the question is answered first by Hooley [Ho63].
More compact expression of the constant in terms of Hurwitz class numbers (when $a = 1$)
is given by McKey in [Mc95], [Mc97], [Mc99].

TODO: formalize Hurwitz class numbers and the expression of the constant in terms of them.

More concrete example for $f(n) = n^2 + 1$, where the asymptote is
$\sum_{n \le x} \tau(n^2 + 1) \sim \frac{3}{\pi} x \log x + O(x)$. See Tao's blog [T].
