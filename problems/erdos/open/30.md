## Problem Statement

Let $h(N)$ be the maximum size of a Sidon set in $\{1,\ldots,N\}$. Is it true that, for every $\epsilon&#62;0$,
$h(N) = N^{1/2}+O_\epsilon(N^\epsilon)?$

## Background

It may even be true that $h(N)=N^{1/2}+O(1)$, but Erdős remarks this is perhaps too optimistic. Erdős and Tur&#225;n [[ErTu41]](javascript:void(0);) proved an upper bound of $N^{1/2}+O(N^{1/4})$, with an alternative proof by Lindstr&#246;m [[Li69]](javascript:void(0);). Both proofs in fact give
$h(N) \leq N^{1/2}+N^{1/4}+1.$
Balogh, F&#252;redi, and Roy [[BFR21]](javascript:void(0);) improved the bound in the error term to $0.998N^{1/4}$, which has been further optimised by O'Bryant [[OB22]](javascript:void(0);) to yield
$h(N)\leq N^{1/2}+0.99703N^{1/4}$
for sufficiently large $N$.
