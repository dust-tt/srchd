## Definitions

A sequence $a_n$ of integers is called an irrationality sequence if for every bounded sequence of integers $b_n$ with $a_n + b_n \neq 0$ and
$b_n \neq 0$ for all $n$, the sum
$$
  \sum \frac{1}{a_n + b_n}
$$
is irrational.
Note: there are other possible definitions of this concept.

Is $2^n$ an example of an irrationality sequence? Kovač and Tao proved that it is not [KoTa24]

Is $n!$ an example of an irrationality sequence?

## Problem Statement

*Problem statement not available locally. See [erdosproblems.com/264](https://www.erdosproblems.com/264) for details.*

## Variants and Related Results

One example is $2^{2^n}$.

Kovač and Tao [KoTa24] generally proved that any strictly increasing sequence of positive integers
$a_n$ such that $\sum \frac{1}{a_n}$ converges and
$$
  \liminf_{n \to \infty} (a_n^2 \sum_{k > n} \frac{1}{a_k^2}) > 0
$$
is not an irrationality sequence.

On the other hand, Kovač and Tao [KoTa24] do prove that for any function $F$ with
$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{F(n + 1)}{F(n)} = \infty$ there exists such an irrationality sequence with $a_n \sim F(n)$.
