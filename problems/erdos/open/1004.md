## Definitions

`IsDistinctTotientRun n K` means that the values `φ(n+1), φ(n+2), ..., φ(n+K)` are all distinct.

For any fixed c > 0, if x is sufficiently large then there exists n ≤ x such that
the values of φ(n+k) are all distinct for 1 ≤ k ≤ (log x)^c.
This is an open problem.

Erdős, Pomerance, and Sárközy [EPS87] proved that if φ(n+k) are all distinct for 1 ≤ k ≤ K then
K ≤ n / exp(c (log n)^{1/3}) for some constant c > 0.
Here we state the existence of such a constant c.
