## Problem Statement

Let $F(n)$ be maximal such that every graph on $n$ vertices contains a regular induced subgraph on at least $F(n)$ vertices. Prove that $F(n)/\log n\to \infty$.

## Background

Conjectured by Erdős, Fajtlowicz, and Stanton. It is known that $F(5)=3$ and $F(7)=4$. 

Ramsey's theorem implies that $F(n)\gg \log n$. Bollobás observed that $F(n)\ll n^{1/2+o(1)}$. Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov [[AKS07]](#cite-AKS07-82) have improved this to $n^{1/2}(\log n)^{O(1)}$.

In [[Er93]](#cite-Er93-82) Erdős asks whether, if $t(n)$ is the largest trivial (either empty or complete) subgraph which a graph on $n$ vertices must contain (so that $t(n) \gg \log n$ by Ramsey's theorem), then is it true that$F(n)-t(n)\to \infty?$Equivalently, and in analogue with the definition of Ramsey numbers, one can define $G(n)$ to be the minimal $m$ such that every graph on $m$ vertices contains a regular induced subgraph on at least $n$ vertices. This problem can be rephrased as asking whether $G(n) \leq 2^{o(n)}$. 

Fajtlowicz, McColgan, Reid, and Staton [[FMRS95]](#cite-FMRS95-82) showed that $G(1)=1$, $G(2)=2$, $G(3)=5$, $G(4)=7$, and $G(5)\geq 12$. Boris Alexeev and Brendan McKay (see the comments and [this site](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/ramsey.html)) have computed $G(5)=17$, $G(6)\geq 21$, and $G(7)\geq 29$.
