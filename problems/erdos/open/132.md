## Problem Statement

Let $A\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be a set of $n$ points. Must there be two distances which occur at least once but between at most $n$ pairs of points? Must the number of such distances $\to \infty$ as $n\to \infty$?

## Background

Asked by Erdős and Pach. Hopf and Pannowitz [[HoPa34]](#cite-HoPa34-132) proved that the largest distance between points of $A$ can occur at most $n$ times, but it is unknown whether a second such distance must occur.

It may be true that there are at least $n^{1-o(1)}$ many such distances. In [[Er97e]](#cite-Er97e-132) Erdős offers \$100 for 'any nontrivial result'.

Erdős [[Er84c]](#cite-Er84c-132) believed that for $n\geq 5$ there must always exist at least two such distances. This is false for $n=4$, as witnessed by two equilateral triangles of the same side-length glued together. Erdős and Fishburn [[ErFi95]](#cite-ErFi95-132) proved this is true for $n=5$ and $n=6$.

Clemen, Dumitrescu, and Liu [[CDL25]](#cite-CDL25-132) have proved that there always at least two such distances if $A$ is in convex position (that is, no point lies inside the convex hull of the others). They also prove it is true if the set $A$ is 'not too convex', in a specific technical sense.
