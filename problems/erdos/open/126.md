## Problem Statement

Let $f(n)$ be maximal such that if $A\subseteq\mathbb{N}$ has $|A| = n$ then
$\prod_{a\neq b\in A}(a + b)$ has at least $f(n)$ distinct prime factors.
Is it true that $\frac{f(n)}{\log n} \to\infty$?

## Variants and Related Results

Erdős and Turán proved [ErTu34] in their first joint paper that
$$
  \log n \ll f(n) \ll \frac{n}{\log n}
$$

[ErTu34] Erdős, Paul and Turan, Paul, _On a Problem in the Elementary Theory of Numbers_. Amer. Math. Monthly (1934), 608-611.

Erdős says that $f(n) = o(\frac{n}{\log n})$ has never been proved.
