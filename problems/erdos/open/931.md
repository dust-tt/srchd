## Definitions

Let $k_1 \geq k_2 \geq 3$. Are there only finitely many $n_2\geq n_1 + k_1$
such that
$$
  \prod_{1\leq i\leq k_1}(n_1 + i)\ \text{and}\ \prod_{1\leq j\leq k_2} (n_2 + j)
$$
have the same prime factors?

## Problem Statement

*Problem statement not available locally. See [erdosproblems.com/931](https://www.erdosproblems.com/931) for details.*

## Variants and Related Results

Erdős thought perhaps if the two products have the same factors then
$n_2 > 2(n_1 + k_1)$.
It is an open question whether this is true when allowing a finite number of counterexamples.

In fact there exist counterexamples, like this one found by AlphaProof.

Erdős was unable to prove that if the two products have the same factors
then there must exist a prime between $n_1$ and $n_2$.
