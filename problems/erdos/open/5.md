## Problem Statement

Let $C\geq 0$. Is there an infinite sequence of $n_i$ such that
$\lim_{i\to \infty}\frac{p_{n_i+1}-p_{n_i}}{\log n_i}=C?$

## Background

Let $S$ be the set of limit points of $(p_{n+1}-p_n)/\log n$. This problem asks whether $S=[0,\infty]$. Although this conjecture remains unproven, a lot is known about $S$. Some highlights: $\infty\in S$ by Westzynthius' result [[We31]](javascript:void(0);) on large prime gaps,
$0\in S$ by the work of Goldston, Pintz, and Yildirim [[GPY09]](javascript:void(0);) on small prime gaps,
Erdős [[Er55]](javascript:void(0);) and Ricci [[Ri56]](javascript:void(0);) independently showed that $S$ has positive Lebesgue measure, Hildebrand and Maier [[HiMa88]](javascript:void(0);) showed that $S$ contains arbitrarily large (finite) numbers, Pintz [[Pi16]](javascript:void(0);) showed that there exists some small constant $c&#62;0$ such that $[0,c]\subset S$, Banks, Freiberg, and Maynard [[BFM16]](javascript:void(0);) showed that at least $12.5\%$ of $[0,\infty)$ belongs to $S$, Merikoski [[Me20]](javascript:void(0);) showed that at least $1/3$ of $[0,\infty)$ belongs to $S$, and that $S$ has bounded gaps.
