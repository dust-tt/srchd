## Definitions

Let `f n` be the smallest integer for which `n!` can be represented as the product of distinct
integers greater than n, the largest of which is `f n`. -/
noncomputable def f (n : ℕ) : ℕ := sInf {m : ℕ | ∃ k, ∃ f : ℕ → ℕ, StrictMono f ∧
  n < f 0 ∧ f (k - 1) = m ∧ ∏ i < k, f i = n !}

/-- `f n - 2 * n = θ (n / log n)`. This is proved in [EGS82].

Does there exists a constant `c` such that `f n - 2 * n ~ c * (n / log n)`?
