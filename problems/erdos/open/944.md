## Definitions

Let $k \ge 4$ and $r\ge 1$. Must there exist a graph $G$ with chromatic number $k$
 such that every vertex is critical, yet every critical set of edges has size $>r$?

The case $k=4$ and $r=1$ remains open: Are there $4$-critical graphs without any critical edges?

## Problem Statement

The predicate that graph $G$ with chromatic number $k$ is such that every vertex is critical, yet
every critical set of edges has size $>r$

## Variants and Related Results

Let $k \ge 4$. Must there exist a graph $G$ with chromatic number $k$
such that every vertex is critical, yet every critical set of edges has size $>1$?

This was conjectured by Dirac in 1970.

Dirac's conjecture was proved, for $k=5$: There exists a graph $G$ with chromatic number $5$, such
that every vertex is critical, yet every critical set of edges has size $>1$, or in other words:
has no critical edge.

Lattanzio [La02] proved there exist $k$-critical graphs without critical edges for all $k$ such that
$k - 1$ is not prime.

Jensen [Je02] gave an construction for $k$-critical graphs without any critical edges for all $k ≥ 5$.

Martinsson and Steiner [MaSt25] proved for every $r \ge 1$ if $k$ is sufficiently large, depending
on $r$, there exist a graph $G$ with chromatic number $k$ such that every vertex is critical,
yet every critical set of edges has size $>r$.
