## Definitions

Let $k ≥ 2$. Does $((n+k)!)^2∣(2n)!$ hold for infinitely many $n$?

It is open even for $k = 2$.
Let $k = 2$. Does $((n+k)!)^2∣(2n)!$ hold for infinitely many n?

Balakran proved this holds for $k = 1$.

Let $k = 1$. Does $((n+k)!)^2∣(2n)!$ for infinitely many $n$?

Erdős, Graham, Ruzsa, and Straus observe that the method of Balakran can be further used to prove
that there are infinitely many $n$ such that $(n+k)!(n+1)!∣(2n)!$
