## Problem Statement

Let $c&#62;0$ and let $f_c(n)$ be the maximal $m$ such that every graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and at least $cn^2$ edges, where each edge is contained in at least one triangle, must contain a book of size $m$, that is, an edge shared by at least $m$ different triangles. 

Estimate $f_c(n)$. In particular, is it true that $f_c(n)&#62;n^{\epsilon}$ for some $\epsilon&#62;0$? Or $f_c(n)\gg \log n$?

## Background

A problem of Erdős and Rothschild.  Alon and Trotter showed that, provided $c<1/4$, $f_c(n)\ll_c n^{1/2}$. Szemerédi observed that his regularity lemma implies that $f_c(n)\to \infty$.

Edwards (unpublished) and Khadziivanov and Nikiforov [[KhNi79]](#cite-KhNi79-80) proved independently that $f_c(n) \geq n/6$ when $c>1/4$ (see [[905]](/905)).

Fox and Loh [[FoLo12]](#cite-FoLo12-80) proved that$f_c(n) \leq n^{O(1/\log\log n)}$for all $c<1/4$, disproving the first conjecture of Erdős.

The best known lower bounds for $f_c(n)$ are those from Szemerédi's regularity lemma, and as such remain very poor.
