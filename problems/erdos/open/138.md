## Definitions

The set of natural numbers that guarantee a monochromatic arithmetic progression.

A number `N` belongs to this set if, for a given number of colors `r` and an arithmetic
progression length `k`, any `r`-coloring of the integers `{1, ..., N}` must contain a
monochromatic arithmetic progression of length `k`.

Asserts that for any number of colors `r` and any progression length `k`, there
always exists some number `N` large enough to guarantee a monochromatic arithmetic progression.
In other words, the set `monoAP_guarantee_set` is non-empty. This is the fundamental existence
result that allows for the definition of the van der Waerden numbers.

The **van der Waerden number**, is the smallest integer `N` such that any `r`-coloring of
`{1, ..., N}` is guaranteed to contain a monochromatic arithmetic progression of
length `k`. It is defined as the infimum of the (non-empty) set of all such numbers `N`.

/--
An abbreviation for the van der Waerden number for 2 colors, commonly written as `W(k)`.
This represents the smallest integer `N` such that any 2-coloring of `{1, ..., N}`
must contain a monochromatic arithmetic progression of length `k`.

In [Er80] Erdős asks whether
$$ \lim_{k \to \infty} (W(k))^{1/k} = \infty $$
