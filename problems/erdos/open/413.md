## Definitions

`IsBarrier f n` means `n` is a barrier for the real-valued function `f`,
i.e. `(m : ℝ) + f m ≤ (n : ℝ)` for all `m < n`.

Are there infinitely many barriers for `ω`?

`expProd n` is `∏ kᵢ` when `n = ∏ pᵢ ^ kᵢ`, i.e. the product of the prime exponents of `n`.

Erdős proved that the barrier set for `expProd` is infinite and even has positive density.

Erdős believed there should be infinitely many barriers for `Ω`, the total prime multiplicity.

Selfridge computed that the largest `Ω`-barrier below `10^5` is `99840`.

Does there exist some `ε > 0` such that there are infinitely many `ε`-barriers for `ω`?
