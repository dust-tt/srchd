## Definitions

A predicate for $n$ to be the sum of three $k$th powers.

The number of integers $\leq x$ which are the sum of three $k$th powers. -/

Writing $f_{k, 3}(x)$ for the number of integers $\leq x$ which are the sum of three $k$th powers,
is it true that $f_{k, 3}(x) \gg x ^ (3 / k)$?

Writing $f_{k, 3}(x)$ for the number of integers $\leq x$ which are the sum of three $k$th powers,
is it even true that $f_{k, 3}(x) \gg_{\epsilon} x ^ (3 / k - \epsilon)$?
