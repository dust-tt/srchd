## Definitions

The prime number theorem immediately implies a lower bound of $\gg N(\log N)^2$ for the sum of
squares of gaps between consecutive primes.

A conjecture by Heath-Brown:
The sum of squares of the first $N$ gaps between consecutive primes behaves like $N * (log N)^2$.

Cramér proved an upper bound of $O(N(\log N)^4)$ conditional on the Riemann hypothesis.
