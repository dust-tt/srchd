## Problem Statement

`DivisorSumSet t` is the set of natural numbers `n` such that `t` can be represented as
a sum of distinct divisors of `n`.

## Variants and Related Results

A weaker version of the problem proved by Erdos:
The density `dₜ` of `DivisorSumSet (t : ℕ)` is bounded from below by `1 / log (t) ^ c₃` and
from above by `1 / log (t) ^ c₄` for some positive constants `c₃` and `c₄`.
