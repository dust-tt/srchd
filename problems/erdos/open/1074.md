## Definitions

Let $S$ be the set of all $m\geq 1$ such that there exists a prime $p\not\equiv 1\pmod{m}$ such
that $m! + 1 \equiv 0\pmod{p}$. Does
$$
  \lim\frac{|S\cap[1, x]|}{x}
$$
exist?

Let $S$ be the set of all $m\geq 1$ such that there exists a prime $p\not\equiv 1\pmod{m}$ such
that $m! + 1 \equiv 0\pmod{p}$. What is
$$
  \lim\frac{|S\cap[1, x]|}{x}?
$$

Similarly, if $P$ is the set of all primes $p$ such that there exists an $m$ with
$p\not\equiv 1\pmod{m}$ such that $m! + 1 \equiv 0\pmod{p}$, then does
$$
  \lim\frac{|P\cap[1, x]|}{\pi(x)}
$$
exist?

## Problem Statement

The EHS numbers (after Erdős, Hardy, and Subbarao) are those $m\geq 1$ such that there
exists a prime $p\not\equiv 1\pmod{m}$ such that $m! + 1 \equiv 0\pmod{p}$.

## Variants and Related Results

Pillai [Pi30] raised the question of whether there exist any primes in $P$. This was answered
by Chowla, who noted that, for example, $14! + 1 \equiv 18! + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}$.

Erdős, Hardy, and Subbarao proved that $S$ is infinite.

Erdős, Hardy, and Subbarao proved that $P$ is infinite.

The sequence $S$ begins $8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, ...$

The sequence $P$ begins $23, 29, 59, 61, 67, 71, ...$

Regarding the first question, Hardy and Subbarao computed all EHS numbers up to $2^{10}$, and
write "...if this trend conditions we expect [the limit] to be around 0.5, if it exists."
