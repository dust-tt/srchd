## Definitions

The sequence of integers A_u which are not divisible by any u_i
arranged in a monotonic sequence. -/
noncomputable def A (u : ℕ → ℕ) (n : ℕ) : ℕ :=
  Nat.nth (fun a => a ∈ ASet u) n

/-- t_x such that u_0 ... u_{t_x-1} ≤ x < u_0 ... u_{t_x}.
-/
noncomputable def t (u : ℕ → ℕ) (x : ℕ) : ℕ :=
  sSup { k | ∏ i ∈ Finset.range k, u i ≤ x }

/-- A sequence is "good" if
1. it is strictly monotone
2. it is pairwise coprime
3. the sum of reciprocals converges
4. the gap between consecutive elements in A(u) is bounded relative to t_x.

1. There is NO good sequence with polynomial growth.

2. There is a good sequence with sub-exponential growth.

## Problem Statement

The set of integers not divisible by any u_i.
