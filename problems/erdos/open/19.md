## Problem Statement

If $G$ is an edge-disjoint union of $n$ copies of $K_n$ then is $\chi(G)=n$?

## Background

Conjectured by Faber, Lov&#225;sz, and Erdős (apparently 'at a party in Boulder, Colarado in September 1972' [[Er81]](javascript:void(0);)). Kahn [[Ka92]](javascript:void(0);) proved that $\chi(G)\leq (1+o(1))n$ (for which Erdős gave him a 'consolation prize' of \$100). Hindman has proved the conjecture for $n&#60;10$. Kang, Kelly, K&#252;hn, Methuku, and Osthus [[KKKMO21]](javascript:void(0);) have proved the answer is yes for all sufficiently large $n$. In [[Er97d]](javascript:void(0);) Erdős asks how large $\chi(G)$ can be if instead of asking for the copies of $K_n$ to be edge disjoint we only ask for their intersections to be triangle free, or to contain at most one edge.
