## Definitions

$v(n,k)$ counts the prime factors of $n+k$ which do not divide $n+i$
for all $0 \le i < k$.

$v_0(n)$ is the supremum of $v(n,k)$ for all $k \ge 0$.

Let $v(n,k)$ count the prime factors of $n+k$ which
do not divide $n+i$ for $0\leq i < k$. Is it true that
$v_0(n)=\max_{k\geq 0}v(n,k)\to \infty$ as $n\to \infty$?

## Problem Statement

$V(n,k)$ is the number of primes $p$ such that
$p^\alpha$ exactly divides $n+k$ and
for all $0 \le i < k$, $p^\alpha$ does not divide $n+i$,
where $\alpha$ is the multiplicity of $p$ in the factorization of $n+k$.

This is a modification of `erdos_889.variants.v1_eq_1_finite`,
which might make it more amenable to attack according to [ErSe67].
