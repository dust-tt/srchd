## Definitions

Let $\epsilon > 0$. Is there some set $A\subset\mathbb{N}$ of density $> 1 - \epsilon$
such that $a_1\cdots a_r = b_1\cdots b_s$ with $a_i, b_j\in A$ can only hold when
$r = s$?

Is there some set $A\subset\{1, ..., N\}$ of size $\geq (1 - o(1))N$ such that
$a_1\cdots a_r = b_1\cdots b_s$ with $a_i, b_j\in A$ can only hold when
$r = s$?

An example of such a set with density $\frac 1 4$ is given by the integers $\equiv 2\pmod{4}$

`consecutivePrimes p` asserts that `p` is a strictly increasing finite sequences of
consecutive primes.

Let $\epsilon > 0$ be given. Then, for a sequence of sufficiently large
consecutive primes $p_1 < \cdots < p_k$ such that
$$
\sum_{i=1}^k \frac{1}{p_i} < 1 < \sum_{i=1}^{k + 1} \frac{1}{p_i},
$$
the set $A$ of all naturals divisible by exactly one of $p_1, ..., p_k$ has
density $\frac{1}{e} - \epsilon$ and has the property that $a_1\cdots a_r = b_1\cdots b_s$
with $a_i, b_j\in A$ can only hold when $r = s$.

## Problem Statement

`Nat.IsMulCardSet A` means that `A` is a set of natural numbers that
satisfies the property that $a_1\cdots a_r = b_1\cdots b_s$ with $a_i, b_j\in A$
can only hold when $r = s$.
