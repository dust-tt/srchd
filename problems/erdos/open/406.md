## Metadata

- **Status:** open
- **Formalized:** Yes ([Lean](https://github.com/google-deepmind/formal-conjectures/blob/main/FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/406.lean))

## Definitions

Is it true that there are only finitely many powers of $2$ which have only the digits $0$
and $1$ when written in base $3$?

## Problem Statement

*Problem statement not available locally. See [erdosproblems.com/406](https://www.erdosproblems.com/406) for details.*

## Variants and Related Results

If we only allow the digits $1$ and $2$ then $2^{15}$ seems to be the largest such power
of $2$.
