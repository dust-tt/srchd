## Problem Statement

Given $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ the number of distinct unit circles containing at least three points is $o(n^2)$.

## Background

In [[Er81d]](#cite-Er81d-104) Erdős proved that $\gg n$ many circles is possible, and that there cannot be more than $O(n^2)$ many circles. The argument is very simple: every pair of points determines at most $2$ unit circles, and the claimed bound follows from double counting. Erdős claims in a number of places this produces the upper bound $n(n-1)$, but Harborth and Mengerson [[HaMe86]](#cite-HaMe86-104) note that in fact this delivers an upper bound of $\frac{n(n-1)}{3}$. 

Elekes [[El84]](#cite-El84-104) has a simple construction of a set with $\gg n^{3/2}$ such circles. This may be the correct order of magnitude.

In [[Er75h]](#cite-Er75h-104) and [[Er92e]](#cite-Er92e-104) Erdős also asks how many such unit circles there must be if the points are in general position.

In [[Er92e]](#cite-Er92e-104) Erdős offered £100 for a proof or disproof that the answer is $O(n^{3/2})$.

The maximal number of unit circles achieved by $n$ points is [A003829](https://oeis.org/A003829) in the OEIS.
