## Definitions

Let `A ⊆ ℕ` be a set such that `A + A` has positive density. Can one always decompose
`A` as a disjoint union of two subsets `A₁` and `A₂` such that both `A₁ + A₁` and `A₂ + A₂` have
positive density?

Let `A ⊆ ℕ` be a basis of order 2. Can one always decompose `A` as a disjoint union of two
subsets `A₁` and `A₂` such that `A₁ + A₁` and `A₂ + A₂` cannot both have bounded gaps?
