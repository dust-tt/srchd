## Definitions

When $A_n = n$, the function $f$ defined above counts the number of odd divisors of $n$.

Let $A=\{a_1 < \cdots\}$ be an infinite sequence of integers. Let $f(n)$ count the number of
solutions to \[n=\sum_{u\leq i\leq v}a_i.\]
Is there such an $A$ for which $f(n)\to \infty$ as $n\to \infty$?

Let $A=\{a_1 < \cdots\}$ be an infinite sequence of integers. Let $f(n)$ count the number of
solutions to \[n=\sum_{u\leq i\leq v}a_i.\]
Is there an $A$ such that $f(n)\geq 2$ for all large $n$?

## Variants and Related Results

When $A =\{a_1 < \cdots\}$ corresponds to the set of primes, it is conjectured that the
$\limsup$ of the number of representations \[n=\sum_{u\leq i\leq v}a_i\] is infinite.

When $A =\{a_1 < \cdots\}$ corresponds to the set of primes, it is conjectured that the set of
numbers $n$ that have representations \[n=\sum_{u\leq i\leq v}a_i\] has positive upper density.

It is conjectured that if $A =\{a_1 < \cdots\}$ and $g$ counts the number of representations
\[n=\sum_{u\leq i\leq v}a_i\] such that the sum has at least two terms, then for all $n$ we have
$1 \leq g(n)$ for sufficiently large $n$.
