## Definitions

The set of numbers $k$ such that $\mathbb{R}^2$ can be red/blue coloured with no pair of red
points unit distance apart, and no $k$-term arithmetic progression of blue points with distance 1.

Old and new problems and results in combinatorial number theory by Erdős & Graham (Page 14, 15):

It has been shown that there is a large $M$ so that it is possible to partition $\mathbb{E}^2$ into
two sets $A$ and $B$ so that $A$ contains no pair of points with distance 1 and $B$ contains no A.P.
of length $M$.

Old and new problems and results in combinatorial number theory by Erdős & Graham (Page 15):

How small can $M$ be made? The only estimate currently known is that $M \le 10000000$ (more or less).
In the other direction, it has just been shown by R. Juhász [Ju (79)] that we must have $M \ge 5$.

What is the smallest $k$ such that $\mathbb{R}^2$ can be red/blue coloured with no pair of red
points unit distance apart, and no $k$-term arithmetic progression of blue points with distance 1?
