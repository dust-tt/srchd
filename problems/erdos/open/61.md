## Problem Statement

The Erdős–Hajnal Conjecture states that there is a constant $c(H) > 0$ for each
$H$ such that we can take $f(n) = n^{c(H)}$ in the above formulation.

## Variants and Related Results

Erdős and Hajnal [ErHa89] proved that we can take $f(n) = \exp(c_H \sqrt{\log n})$
for some constant $c_H > 0$ dependending on $H$.

Bucić, Nguyen, Scott, and Seymour [BNSS23] improved this to
$f(n) = \exp(c_H \sqrt{\log n \log \log n})$ for some constant $c_H > 0$ dependending on $H$.
