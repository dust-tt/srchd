## Problem Statement

Is it true that 
$\sum_{n=1}^\infty(-1)^n\frac{n}{p_n}$
converges, where $p_n$ is the sequence of primes?

## Background

Erdős suggested that a computer could be used to explore this, and did not see any other method to attack this. Tao [[Ta23]](javascript:void(0);) has proved that this series does converge assuming a strong form of the Hardy-Littlewood prime tuples conjecture.
