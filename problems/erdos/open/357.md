such that all sums of the shape $\sum_{u \le i \le v} a_i$ are distinct. -/

## Variants and Related Results

Let $f(n)$ be the maximal $k$ such that there exist integers $1 \le a_1 < \dotsc < a_k \le n$
such that all sums of the shape $\sum_{u \le i \le v} a_i$ are distinct.
It is known that $f(n) \geq (2+o(1))\sqrt{n}$.

Suppose $A$ is an infinite set such that all finite sums of consecutive terms of $A$ are distinct.
Then $A$ has lower density 0.

Suppose $A$ is an infinite set such that all finite sums of consecutive terms of $A$ are distinct.
Then it is conjectured that $A$ has density 0.

-- The analogous question assuming only monotonicity of the $a_i$. The wording of the website
-- suggests that this is open, though it's not clear whether the difficulty is the same as for the
-- strictly monotone case.
