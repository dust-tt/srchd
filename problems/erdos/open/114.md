## Problem Statement

If $p(z)\in\mathbb{C}[z]$ is a monic polynomial of degree $n$ then is the length of the curve $\{ z\in \mathbb{C} : \lvert p(z)\rvert=1\}$ maximised when $p(z)=z^n-1$?

## Background

A problem of Erdős, Herzog, and Piranian [[EHP58]](#cite-EHP58-114). Let the maximal length of such a curve be denoted by $f(n)$.

The length of the curve when $p(z)=z^n-1$ is $2n+O(1)$, and hence the conjecture implies in particular that $f(n)=2n+O(1)$.
Dolzhenko [[Do61]](#cite-Do61-114) proved $f(n) \leq 4\pi n$, but few were aware of this work.
Pommerenke [[Po61]](#cite-Po61-114) proved $f(n)\ll n^2$.
Borwein [[Bo95]](#cite-Bo95-114) proved $f(n)\ll n$ (Borwein was unaware of Dolzhenko's earlier work). The prize of \$250 is reported by Borwein [[Bo95]](#cite-Bo95-114).
Eremenko and Hayman [[ErHa99]](#cite-ErHa99-114) proved the full conjecture when $n=2$, and $f(n)\leq 9.173n$ for all $n$.
Danchenko [[Da07]](#cite-Da07-114) proved $f(n)\leq 2\pi n$.
Fryntov and Nazarov [[FrNa09]](#cite-FrNa09-114) proved that $z^n-1$ is a local maximiser, and solved this problem asymptotically, proving that$f(n)\leq 2n+O(n^{7/8}).$

Erdős, Herzog, and Piranian [[EHP58]](#cite-EHP58-114) also ask whether the length is at least $2\pi$ if $\{ z: \lvert f(z)\rvert<1\}$ is connected (which $z^n$ shows is the best possible). This was proved by Pommerenke [[Po59]](#cite-Po59-114).
