## Definitions

This defines the core property of the problem: For what values of $t,\alpha \in (0,\infty)$
is the sequence $\lfloor t\alpha^n\rfloor$ complete?

For what values of $t,\alpha \in (0,\infty)$ is the sequence $\lfloor t\alpha^n\rfloor$ complete
(that is, all sufficiently large integers are the sum of distinct integers of the form $\lfloor t\alpha^n\rfloor$)?

It seems likely that the sequence is complete for all
for all $t>0$ and all $1 < \alpha < \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$.

For any $k$ there exists some $t_k\in (0,1)$ such that the set of $\alpha$
such that the sequence $\lfloor t_k\alpha^n\rfloor$ is complete consists of at least $k$
disjoint line segments.

## Variants and Related Results

Is it true that the terms of the sequence $\lfloor (3/2)^n\rfloor$ are odd infinitely
often and even infinitely often?

Is it true that the terms of the sequence $\lfloor (3/2)^n\rfloor$ are even infinitely often?
