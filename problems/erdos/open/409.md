## Definitions

How many iterations of $n\mapsto\phi(n) + 1$ are needed before a prime is reached?
-/
-- Formalisation note: the sequence of iterates always terminates if `n > 0`
-- since it is strictly decreasing unless the input is prime, at which point
-- it becomes static. See also https://oeis.org/A039651

theorem erdos_409.parts.i (n : ℕ) (hn : 0 < n) :
    IsLeast { i | (φ · + 1)^[i] n |>.Prime } answer(sorry) 

/-- If $n > 0$, then the iteration $n\mapsto\phi(n) + 1$ necessarily
reaches a prime.

Can infinitely many $n$ reach the same prime under the iteration $n\mapsto\phi(n) + 1$?

What is the density of $n$ which reach any fixed prime under the iteration $n\mapsto\phi(n) + 1$?
