## Definitions

For a given point `x` and a set of other points, this function finds the maximum number of points
that lie on a single circle centered at `x`. It does this by grouping the other points by their
distance to `x` and finding the size of the largest group.

noncomputable def maxEquidistantPointsAt (x : ℝ²) (points : Finset ℝ²) : ℕ :=
  letI otherPoints := points.erase x
  letI distances := otherPoints.image (dist x)
  sSup (distances.image fun d ↦ (otherPoints.filter fun p ↦ dist x p = d).card)

/--
This property holds for a set of points `A` if every point `x` in `A` has at least `k` other
points from `A` that are equidistant from `x`.

The set of all possible values `k` for which there exists a set of `n` points
satisfying the `hasMinEquidistantProperty k`. The function `f(n)` will be the supremum of this set.

noncomputable def possible_f_values (n : ℕ) : Set ℕ :=
  {k | ∃ (points : Finset ℝ²) (_ : points.card = n), hasMinEquidistantProperty k points}

/--
A sanity check to ensure the set of possible `f(n)` values is bounded above. A trivial bound is
`n-1`, since any point can have at most `n-1` other points equidistant from it.
This ensures `sSup` is well-defined.

## Problem Statement

Let $f(n)$ be maximal such that there exists a set $A$ of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ in which every $x\in A$ has at least $f(n)$ points in $A$ equidistant from $x$.

Is it true that $f(n)\leq n^{o(1)}$? Or even $f(n) &#60; n^{O(1/\log\log n)}$?

## Background

This is a stronger form of the unit distance conjecture (see [[90]](/90)).

The set of lattice points imply $f(n) > n^{c/\log\log n}$ for some constant $c>0$. Erdős offered \$500 for a proof that $f(n) \leq n^{o(1)}$ but only \$100 for a counterexample. This latter prize is downgraded to \$50 in [[ErFi97]](#cite-ErFi97-92).

It is trivial that $f(n) \ll n^{1/2}$. A result of Pach and Sharir (Theorem 4 of [[PaSh92]](#cite-PaSh92-92)) implies $f(n) \ll n^{2/5}$. Hunter has observed that the circle-point incidence bound of Janzer, Janzer, Methuku, and Tardos [[JJMT24]](#cite-JJMT24-92) implies$f(n) \ll n^{4/11}.$Fishburn (personal communication to Erdős, later published in [[ErFi97]](#cite-ErFi97-92)) proved that $6$ is the smallest $n$ such that $f(n)=3$ and $8$ is the smallest $n$ such that $f(n)=4$, and suggested that the lattice points may not be best example.

See also [[754]](/754).

## Variants and Related Results

Let $f(n)$ be maximal such that there exists a set $A$ of $n$ points in $\mathbb^2$
in which every $x \in A$ has at least $f(n)$ points in $A$ equidistant from $x$.

Or even $f(n) < n^{c/\log\log n}$ for some constant $c > 0$?
