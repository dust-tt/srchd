## Definitions

Are there infinitely many solutions to $\phi(n) = \phi(n+1)$, where $\phi$ is the Euler totient
function?

## Variants and Related Results

Erdős [Er85e] says that, presumably, for every $k \geq 1$ the equation
$$\phi(n) = \phi(n+1) = \cdots = \phi (n+k)$$ has infinitely many solutions.

Erdős, Pomerance, and Sárközy [EPS87] proved that for all large $x$, the number
of $n \leq x$ with $\phi(n) = \phi(n+1)$ is at most $$\frac{x}{\exp((\log x)^{1/3})}$$.
