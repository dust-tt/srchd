## Definitions

Let $\tau(n)$ count the number of divisors of $n$. Is there some $n > 24$ such that
$$
  \max_{m < n}(m + \tau(m)) \leq n + 2?
$$

*Problem statement not available locally. See [erdosproblems.com/647](https://www.erdosproblems.com/647) for details.*

## Variants and Related Results

This is true for $n = 24$.

Erdős says 'it is extremely doubtful' that there are infinitely many such $n$, and in
fact suggests that
$$
  lim_{n\to\infty} \max_{m < n}(\tau(m) + m − n) = \infty.
$$

Erdős says it 'seems certain' that for every $k$ there are infinitely many $n$
for which
$$
  \max_{n−k < m < n}(m + \tau(m)) ≤ n + 2.
$$
