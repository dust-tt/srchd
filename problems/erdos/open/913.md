## Definitions

Are there infinitely many $n$ such that if
$$
  n(n + 1) = \prod_i p_i^{k_i}
$$
is the factorisation into distinct primes then all exponents $k_i$ are distinct?

## Variants and Related Results

It is likely that there are infinitely many primes $p$ such that $8p^2 - 1$ is also prime.

If there are infinitely many primes $p$ such that $8p^2 - 1$ is prime, then this is true.
