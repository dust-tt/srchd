## Definitions

A set `A` of natural numbers is **d-complete** if every sufficiently large integer
is the sum of distinct elements of `A` such that no element divides another.

Reference: [ErLe96] Erdős, P. and Lewin, M., _$d$-complete sequences of integers_. Math. Comp. (1996).

Characterizes a "snug" finite set of natural numbers:
all elements are within a multiplicative factor $(1 + ε)$ of the minimum.
Specifically, for a finite set $A$ and $ε > 0$, all $a ∈ A$ satisfy $a < (1 + ε) · min(A)$.

## Problem Statement

**Erdős Problem #123**

Let $a, b, c$ be three integers which are pairwise coprime. Is every large integer
the sum of distinct integers of the form $a^k b^l c^m$ ($k, l, m ≥ 0$), none of which
divide any other?

Equivalently: is the set $\{a^k b^l c^m : k, l, m \geq 0\}$ d-complete?

Note: For this not to reduce to the two-integer case, we need the integers
to be greater than one and distinct.

## Variants and Related Results

Erdős and Lewin proved this conjecture when $a = 3$, $b = 5$, and $c = 7$.

A simpler case: the set of numbers of the form $2^k 3^l$ ($k, l ≥ 0$) is d-complete.

This was initially conjectured by Erdős in 1992, who called it a "nice and difficult"
problem, but it was quickly proven by Jansen and others using a simple inductive argument:
- If $n = 2m$ is even, apply the inductive hypothesis to $m$ and double all summands.
- If $n$ is odd, let $3^k$ be the largest power of $3$ with $3^k ≤ n$, and apply the
  inductive hypothesis to $n - 3^k$ (which is even).

A stronger conjecture for numbers of the form $2^k 3^l 5^j$.

For any $ε > 0$, all large integers $n$ can be written as the sum of distinct integers
$b_1 < ... < b_t$ of the form $2^k 3^l 5^j$ where $b_t < (1 + ϵ) b_1$.
