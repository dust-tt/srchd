## Definitions

An exact covering of a group `G` is a finite collection of subgroups `{H_1, ..., H_k}` and
representative `{g_1, ..., g_k}` such that the cosets `g_iH_i` are pairwise disjoint and their
union covers `G`.

Note that this differs from `Partition (α := Subgroup G)` because the covering condition there
invokes `Subgroup.sup` which is subgroup generation and thus stronger than union. This definition
is easier to use in this contect than the alternative `Partition (α := Set G)`, which lacks
subgroup definitions such as `Subgroup.index`. -/

/--
If `G` is a group then can there exist an exact covering of `G` by more than one cosets of
different sizes? (i.e. each element is contained in exactly one of the cosets.)

Let $G$ be a group, and let $A = \{a_1G_1, \dots, a_kG_k\}$ be a finite system of left cosets of
subgroups $G_1, \dots, G_k$ of $G$.

Herzog and Schönheim conjectured that if $A$ forms a partition of $G$ with $k > 1$, then the
indices $[G:G_1], \dots, [G:G_k]$ cannot be distinct.

## Variants and Related Results

If `G` is a finite abelian group then there cannot exist an exact covering of `G` by more
than one cosets of different sizes? (i.e. each element is contained in exactly one
of the cosets.)
