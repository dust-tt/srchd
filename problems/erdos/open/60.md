## Problem Statement

Does every graph on $n$ vertices with $&#62;\mathrm{ex}(n;C_4)$ edges contain $\gg n^{1/2}$ many copies of $C_4$?

## Background

Conjectured by Erdős and Simonovits, who could not even prove that at least $2$ copies of $C_4$ are guaranteed.

He, Ma, and Yang [[HeMaYa21]](javascript:void(0);) have proved this conjecture when $n=q^2+q+1$ for some even integer $q$.
