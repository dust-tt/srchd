## Definitions

If $r≥4$ then can the sum of $r-2$ coprime $r$-powerful numbers ever be itself $r$-powerful?

## Problem Statement

A set `S` belongs to `Erdos939Sums r` if it meets the following criteria:
- The size of the set is `$|S| = r - 2$`.
- The elements of the set are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1).
- Every element in `S` is an `$r$-powerful` number.
- The sum of the elements in `S`, i.e., `$\sum_{s \in S} s$`, is also an `$r$-powerful` number.

## Variants and Related Results

If $r≥4$ are there infinitely many sums of $r-2$ coprime $r$-powerful numbers
that are themselves $r$-powerful?

Are there infinitely many triples of coprime $3$-powerful numbers $a, b, c$ such that $a + b = c$?

Cambie has found several examples of the sum of $r - 2$ coprime $r$-powerful numbers being itself
$r$-powerful. For example when $r=5$ we have
$$3761^5=2^8\cdot3^{10}\cdot 5^7 + 2^{12}\cdot 23^6 + 11^5\cdot 13^5$$.

Cambie has also found solutions when $r=7$.

Cambie has also found solutions when $r=8$.

Euler had conjectured that the sum of $k - 1$ many $k$-th powers is never a
$k$-th power, but this is false for $k=5$, as Lander and Parkin [LaPa67] found
$$27^5+84^5+110^5+133^5=144^5$$.
