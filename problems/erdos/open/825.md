## Definitions

Is there an absolute constant $C > 0$ such that every integer $n$ with
$\sigma(n) > Cn$ is the distinct sum of proper divisors of $n$?

## Variants and Related Results

Show that if the constant $C > 0$ is such that every integer $n$ with
$\sigma(n) > Cn$ is the distinct sum of proper divisors of $n$, then we
must have $C > 2$.
