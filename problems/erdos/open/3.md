## Problem Statement

If $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ has $\sum_{n\in A}\frac{1}{n}=\infty$ then must $A$ contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions?

## Background

This is essentially asking for good bounds on $r_k(N)$, the size of the largest subset of $\{1,\ldots,N\}$ without a non-trivial $k$-term arithmetic progression. For example, a bound like
$r_k(N) \ll_k \frac{N}{(\log N)(\log\log N)^2}$
would be sufficient. Even the case $k=3$ is non-trivial, but was proved by Bloom and Sisask [[BlSi20]](javascript:void(0);). Much better bounds for $r_3(N)$ were subsequently proved by Kelley and Meka [[KeMe23]](javascript:void(0);). Green and Tao [[GrTa17]](javascript:void(0);) proved $r_4(N)\ll N/(\log N)^{c}$ for some small constant $c&#62;0$. Gowers [[Go01]](javascript:void(0);) proved $r_k(N) \ll \frac{N}{(\log\log N)^{c_k}},$
where $c_k&#62;0$ is a small constant depending on $k$. The current best bounds for general $k$ are due to Leng, Sah, and Sawhney [[LSS24]](javascript:void(0);), who show that
$r_k(N) \ll \frac{N}{\exp(-(\log\log N)^{c_k})}$
for some constant $c_k&#62;0$ depending on $k$. Curiously, Erdős [[Er83c]](javascript:void(0);) thought this conjecture was the 'only way to approach' the conjecture that there are arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions of prime numbers, now a theorem due to Green and Tao [[GrTa08]](javascript:void(0);).
