## Variants and Related Results

The set of indices $n$ for which a prime gap is followed by a larger or equal prime gap has a
natural density of $\frac 1 2$.

The set of indices $n$ for which a prime gap is preceeded by a larger or equal prime gap has a
natural density of $\frac 1 2$.

There are infintely many indices $n$ such that the prime gap at $n$ is equal to the prime gap
at $n+1$. This is equivalent to the existence of infinitely many arithmetic progressions of
length $3$, see `erdos_141.variant.infinite_three`.
