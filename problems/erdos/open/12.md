## Definitions

A set `A` is "good" if it is infinite and there are no distinct `a,b,c` in `A`
such that `a ∣ (b+c)` and `b > a`, `c > a`.

The set of $p ^ 2$ where $p \cong 3 \mod 4$ is prime is an example of a good set.

Let $A$ be an infinite set such that there are no distinct $a,b,c \in A$
such that $a \mid (b+c)$ and $b,c > a$. Is there such an $A$ with
$\liminf \frac{|A \cap \{1, \dotsc, N\}|}{N^{1/2}} > 0$ ?

Let $A$ be an infinite set such that there are no distinct $a,b,c \in A$
such that $a \mid (b+c)$ and $b,c > a$. Does there exist some absolute constant $c > 0$
such that there are always infinitely many $N$
with $|A \cap \{1, \dotsc, N\}| < N^{1−c}$?

Let $A$ be an infinite set such that there are no distinct $a,b,c \in A$
such that $a \mid (b+c)$ and $b,c > a$. Is it true that $∑_{n \in A} \frac{1}{n} < \infty$?

## Problem Statement

Let $A$ be an infinite set such that there are no distinct $a,b,c\in A$ such that $a\mid (b+c)$ and $b,c&#62;a$. Is there such an $A$ with
$\liminf \frac{\lvert A\cap\{1,\ldots,N\}\rvert}{N^{1/2}}&#62;0?$
Does there exist some absolute constant $c&#62;0$ such that there are always infinitely many $N$ with
$\lvert A\cap\{1,\ldots,N\}\rvert&#60;N^{1-c}?$

Is it true that 
$\sum_{n\in A}\frac{1}{n}&#60;\infty?$

## Background

Asked by Erdős and S&#225;rk&#246;zy [[ErSa70]](javascript:void(0);), who proved that $A$ must have density $0$. They also prove that this is essentially best possible, in that given any function $f(x)\to \infty$ as $x\to \infty$ there exists a set $A$ with this property and infinitely many $N$ such that
$\lvert A\cap\{1,\ldots,N\}\rvert&#62;\frac{N}{f(N)}.$
(Their example is given by all integers in $(y_i,\frac{3}{2}y_i)$ congruent to $1$ modulo $(2y_{i-1})!$, where $y_i$ is some sufficiently quickly growing sequence.) An example of an $A$ with this property where
$\liminf \frac{\lvert A\cap\{1,\ldots,N\}\rvert}{N^{1/2}}\log N&#62;0$
is given by the set of $p^2$, where $p\equiv 3\pmod{4}$ is prime. For the finite version see [[13]](https://www.erdosproblems.com/13).

Given any function $f(x)\to \infty$ as $x\to \infty$ there exists a set $A$ with the property
that there are no distinct $a,b,c \in A$ such that $a \mid (b+c)$ and $b,c > a$, such that there are
infinitely many $N$ such that \[\lvert A\cap\{1,\ldots,N\}\rvert > \frac{N}{f(N)}.

Let $A$ be a set of natural numbers with the property that there are no distinct $a,b,c \in A$ such
that $a \mid (b+c)$ and $b,c > a$. If all elements in $A$ are pairwise coprime then
