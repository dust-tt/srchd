## Definitions

A sunflower $F$ with kernel $S$ is a collection of sets in which all possible distinct pairs of sets
share the same intersection $S$.

A sunflower $F$ is a collection of sets in which all possible distinct pairs of sets share the
same intersection.

Let $f(n,k)$ be minimal such that every $F$ family of $n$-uniform sets with $|F| \ge f(n,k)$
contains a $k$-sunflower.
