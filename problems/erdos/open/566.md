## Definitions

**Erdős Problem 566**

Let $G$ be such that any subgraph on $k$ vertices has at most $2k-3$ edges.
Is it true that, if $H$ has $m$ edges and no isolated vertices, then $\hat{r}(G,H) \ll m$?

In other words: if $G$ is sparse (every induced subgraph on $k$ vertices has $≤ 2k-3$ edges),
is $G$ Ramsey size linear?
