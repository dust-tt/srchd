## Definitions

The set of natural numbers that can be written as a sum
of a prime and at most $k$ powers of $2$.

Is there some $k$ such that every integer is the sum of a prime and at most $k$
powers of $2$?

## Variants and Related Results

Gallagher [Ga75] has shown that for any $ϵ > 0$ there exists $k(ϵ)$
such that the set of integers which are the sum of a prime and at most $k(ϵ)$
many powers of $2$ has lower density at least $1 - ϵ$.

Granville and Soundararajan [GrSo98] have conjectured that at most $3$
powers of $2$ suffice for all odd integers, and hence at most $4$ powers of $2$
suffice for all even integers.

Bogdan Grechuk has observed that `1117175146` is not the sum of a prime
and at most $3$ powers of $2$.

There are infinitely many even integers not the sum of a prime and $2$ powers of $2$

Bogdan Grechuk has observed that $1117175146$ is not the sum of a prime and at most $3$
powers of $2$, and pointed out that parity considerations, coupled with the fact that there
are many integers not the sum of a prime and $2$ powers of $2$ suggest that there exist
infinitely many even integers which are not the sum of a prime and at most $3$ powers of $2$).
