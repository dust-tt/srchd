## Problem Statement

Give a constructive proof that $R(k)&#62;C^k$ for some constant $C&#62;1$.

## Background

Erdős gave a simple probabilistic proof that $R(k) \gg k2^{k/2}$. 

Equivalently, this question asks for an explicit construction of a graph on $n$ vertices which does not contain any clique or independent set of size $\geq c\log n$ for some constant $c>0$. 

In [[Er69b]](#cite-Er69b-78) Erdős asks for even a construction whose largest clique or independent set has size $o(n^{1/2})$, which is now known.

 Cohen [[Co15]](#cite-Co15-78) (see the introduction for further history) constructed a graph on $n$ vertices which does not contain any clique or independent set of size$\geq 2^{(\log\log n)^{C}}$for some constant $C>0$. Li [[Li23b]](#cite-Li23b-78) has recently improved this to$\geq (\log n)^{C}$for some constant $C>0$.

This problem is [#4 in Ramsey Theory](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~erdosproblems/erdos/newproblems/ConstructiveRamsey.html) in the graphs problem collection.
