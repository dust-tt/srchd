## Definitions

Let `A ⊆ ℕ` be an infinite set such that the triple sums `a + b + c` are all distinct for
`a, b, c` in `A` (aside from the trivial coincidences). Is it true that
`liminf n → ∞ |A ∩ {1, …, N}| / N^(1/3) = 0`?

Erdős proved the following pairwise version.
Let `A ⊆ ℕ` be an infinite set such that the pairwise sums `a + b` are all distinct for `a, b`
in `A` (aside from the trivial coincidences).
Is it true that `liminf n → ∞ |A ∩ {1, …, N}| / N^(1/2) = 0`?

## Problem Statement

For a given set `A`, the n-tuple sums `a₁ + ... + aₙ` are all distinct for  `a₁, ..., aₙ` in `A`
(aside from the trivial coincidences).
