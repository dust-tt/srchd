## Definitions

The maximal number of pairs of points which are distance 1 apart that a set of `n` 1-separated
points in `ℝ^d` make. -/
noncomputable def f (d n : ℕ) : ℕ :=
  ⨆ (s : Finset (ℝ^ d)) (_ : s.card = n) (_ : IsSeparated 1 s.toSet), unitDistNum s

/-- It is easy to check that $f_1(n) = n - 1$.

It is easy to check that $f_2(n) < 3n$.

Erdős showed that there is some constant $c > 0$ such that $f_2(n) < 3n - c n^{1/2}$.

Erdős conjectured that the triangular lattice is best possible in 2D, in particular that
$f_2(3n^2 + 3n + 1) < 9n^2 + 6n$.

Erdős claims the existence of two constants $c_1, c_2 > 0$
such that $6n - c_1 n^{2/3} ≤ f_3(n) \le 6n - c_2 n^{2/3}$.
