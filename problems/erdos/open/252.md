## Definitions

`∑ σ 0 n / n!` is irrational. This is proved in [ErSt71].

`∑ σ 1 n / n!` is irrational. This is proved in [ErSt74].

`∑ σ 2 n / n!` is irrational. This is proved in [ErKa54].

`∑ σ 3 n / n!` is irrational. This is proved in [ScPu06] and [FLC07].

`∑ σ 4 n / n!` is irrational. This is proved in [Pr22].

For a fixed `k ≥ 5`, is `∑ σ k n / n!` irrational?.

If Schinzel's conjecture is true, then `∑ σ k n / n!` is irrational for all `k`. This is proved
in [ScPu06].

If the prime `k`-tuples conjecture is true, then `∑ σ k n / n!` is irrational. This is proved
in [FLC07].
