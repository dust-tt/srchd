## Definitions

Let $f_\max(n)$ be the largest $m$ such that $\phi(m) = n$, and
$f_\min(n)$ be the smallest such $m$, where $\phi$ is Euler's
totient function. Investigate
$$
  \max_{n\leq x}\frac{f_\max(n)}{f_\min(n)}.

## Variants and Related Results

Carmichael has asked whether there is an integer $n$ for which $\phi(m) = n$ has
exactly one solution, that is $\frac{f_\max(n)}{f_\min(n)} = 1$.

Erdős has proved that if there exists an integer $n$ for which $\phi(m) = n$ has
exactly one solution, then there must be infinitely many such $n$.
