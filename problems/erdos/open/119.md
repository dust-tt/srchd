## Definitions

Let $z_i$ be an infinite sequence of complex numbers such that $|z_i| = 1$ for all $i \geq 1$.
For $n \geq 1$ let $p_n(z) = \prod_{i \leq n} (z - z_i)$. -/
noncomputable def p (z : ℕ → ℂ) (n : ℕ) : ℂ → ℂ :=
    fun w => ∏ i ∈ range n, (w - z i)

/-- Let $M_n = \max_{|z| = 1} |p_n(z)|$. -/
noncomputable def M (z : ℕ → ℂ) (n : ℕ) : ℝ :=
    sSup { (‖p z n w‖) | (w : ℂ) (_ : ‖w‖ = 1) }

/-- Question 1:

Is it true that $\limsup M_n = \infty$?

Wagner [Wa80] proved that there is some $c > 0$ with $M_n > (\log n)^c$ infintely often.

Question 2:

Is it true that there exists $c > 0$ such that for infinitely many $n$ we have $M_n > n^c$?

Beck [Be91] proved that there exists some $c > 0$ such that $\max_{n \leq N} M_n > N^c$.

Question 3:

Is it true that there exists $c > 0$ such that, for all large $n$, $\sum_{k \leq n} M_k > n^{1 + c}$?

## Problem Statement

Let $z_i$ be an infinite sequence of complex numbers such that $\lvert z_i\rvert=1$ for all $i\geq 1$, and for $n\geq 1$ let
$p_n(z)=\prod_{i\leq n} (z-z_i).$
Let $M_n=\max_{\lvert z\rvert=1}\lvert p_n(z)\rvert$. Is it true that $\limsup M_n=\infty$? Is it true that there exists $c&#62;0$ such that for infinitely many $n$ we have $M_n &#62; n^c$, or even that for all $n$
$\sum_{k\leq n}M_k &#62; n^{1+c}?$

## Background

The weaker conjecture that $\limsup M_n=\infty$ was proved by Wagner, who show that there is some $c&#62;0$ with $M_n&#62;(\log n)^c$ infinitely often. This was solved by Beck [[Be91]](javascript:void(0);), who proved that there exists some $c&#62;0$ such that
$\max_{n\leq N} M_n &#62; N^c.$
