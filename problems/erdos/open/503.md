## Definitions

What is the size of the largest $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ such that every three points from $A$
determine an isosceles triangle? That is, for any three points $x$, $y$, $z$ from $A$, at least two
of the distances $|x - y|$, $|y - z|$, $|x - z|$ are equal.

## Variants and Related Results

When $n = 2$, the answer is 6 (due to Kelly [ErKe47] - an alternative proof is given by Kovács [Ko24c]).

When $n = 3$, the answer is 8 (due to Croft [Cr62]).

The best upper bound known in general is due to Blokhius [Bl84] who showed that
$$
|A| \leq \binom{n + 2}{2}
$$

[Bl84] Blokhuis, A., Few-distance sets. (1984), iv+70.

Alweiss has observed a lower bound of $\binom{n + 1}{2}$ follows from considering the subset of
$\mathbb{R}^{n + 1}$ formed of all vectors $e_i + e_j$ where $e_i$, $e_j$ are distinct coordinate
vectors. This set can be viewed as a subset of some $\mathbb{R}^n$, and is easily checked to have
the required property.
