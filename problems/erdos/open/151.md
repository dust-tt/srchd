## Problem Statement

For a graph $G$ let $\tau(G)$ denote the minimal number of vertices that include at least one from each maximal clique of $G$ on at least two vertices (sometimes called the clique transversal number).

Let $H(n)$ be maximal such that every triangle-free graph on $n$ vertices contains an independent set on $H(n)$ vertices.

If $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices then is$\tau(G)\leq n-H(n)?$

## Background

It is easy to see that $\tau(G) \leq n-\sqrt{n}$. Note also that if $G$ is triangle-free then trivially $\tau(G)\leq n-H(n)$.

This is listed in [[Er88]](#cite-Er88-151) as a problem of Erdős and Gallai, who were unable to make progress even assuming $G$ is $K_4$-free. There Erdős remarked that this conjecture is 'perhaps completely wrongheaded'. 

It later appeared as Problem 1 in [[EGT92]](#cite-EGT92-151).

The general behaviour of $\tau(G)$ is the subject of [[610]](/610).
