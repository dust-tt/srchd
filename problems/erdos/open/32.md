## Problem Statement

Is there a set $A\subset\mathbb{N}$ such that 
$\lvert A\cap\{1,\ldots,N\}\rvert = o((\log N)^2)$
and such that every large integer can be written as $p+a$ for some prime $p$ and $a\in A$? 

Can the bound $O(\log N)$ be achieved? Must such an $A$ satisfy 
$\liminf \frac{\lvert A\cap\{1,\ldots,N\}\rvert}{\log N}&#62; 1?$

## Background

Such a set is called an additive complement to the primes. Erdős [[Er54]](javascript:void(0);) proved that such a set $A$ exists with $\lvert A\cap\{1,\ldots,N\}\rvert\ll (\log N)^2$ (improving a previous result of Lorentz [[Lo54]](javascript:void(0);) who achieved $\ll (\log N)^3$). Wolke [[Wo96]](javascript:void(0);) has shown that such a bound is almost true, in that we can achieve $\ll (\log N)^{1+o(1)}$ if we only ask for almost all integers to be representable. The answer to the third question is yes: Ruzsa [[Ru98c]](javascript:void(0);) has shown that we must have $\liminf \frac{\lvert A\cap\{1,\ldots,N\}\rvert}{\log N}\geq e^\gamma\approx 1.781.$
