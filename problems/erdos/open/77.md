## Problem Statement

If $R(k)$ is the Ramsey number for $K_k$, the minimal $n$ such that every $2$-colouring of the edges of $K_n$ contains a monochromatic copy of $K_k$, then find the value of$\lim_{k\to \infty}R(k)^{1/k}.$

## Background

Erdős offered \$100 for just a proof of the existence of this constant, without determining its value. He also offered \$1000 for a proof that the limit does not exist, but says 'this is really a joke as [it] certainly exists'. Erdős proved$\sqrt{2}\leq \liminf_{k\to \infty}R(k)^{1/k}\leq \limsup_{k\to \infty}R(k)^{1/k}\leq 4.$The upper bound has been improved to $4-\tfrac{1}{128}$ by Campos, Griffiths, Morris, and Sahasrabudhe [[CGMS23]](#cite-CGMS23-77). This was improved to $3.7992\cdots$ by Gupta, Ndiaye, Norin, and Wei [[GNNW24]](#cite-GNNW24-77).

A shorter and simpler proof of an upper bound of the strength $4-c$ for some constant $c>0$ (and a generalisation to the case of more than two colours) was given by Balister, Bollobás, Campos, Griffiths, Hurley, Morris, Sahasrabudhe, and Tiba [[BBCGHMST24]](#cite-BBCGHMST24-77).

In [[Er93]](#cite-Er93-77) Erdős writes 'I have no idea what the value of $\lim R(k)^{1/k}$ should be, perhaps it is $2$ but we have no real evidence for this.'

This problem is [#3 in Ramsey Theory](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~erdosproblems/erdos/newproblems/RamseyLimit.html) in the graphs problem collection.
