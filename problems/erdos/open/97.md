## Definitions

A two-part partition $\{A, B\}$ of $V$ is a cut if the convex hulls of $A$ and $B$ are disjoint.

## Problem Statement

Does every convex polygon have a vertex with no other 4 vertices equidistant from it?

## Variants and Related Results

Erdős originally conjectured this (in [Er46b]) with no 3 vertices equidistant,
but Danzer found a convex polygon on 9 points such that every vertex has three
vertices equidistant from it (but this distance depends on the vertex).
Danzer's construction is explained in [Er87b].

Erdős also conjectured that there is a $k$ for which every convex polygon has a vertex
with no other $k$ vertices equidistant from it.

Fishburn and Reeds [FiRe92] have found a convex polygon on 20 points such that
every vertex has three vertices equidistant from it (and this distance is the same for all vertices).

[FiRe92] Fishburn, P. C. and Reeds, J. A., _Unit distances between vertices of a convex polygon_. Comput. Geom. (1992), 81-91.

Fishburn and Reeds [FiRe92] also proved that the smallest $n$ for which there exists
a convex $n$-gon and a cut $\{A, B\}$ of its vertices such that $|\{b \in B : d(a, b) = 1\}| ≥ 3$
for all $a \in A$, and $|\{a \in A : d(a, b) = 1\}| ≥ 3$ for all $b \in B$, is $n = 20$.
