## Definitions

A finite set of naturals $A$ is said to be a sum-distinct set for $N \in \mathbb{N}$ if
$A\subseteq\{1, ..., N\}$ and the sums  $\sum_{a\in S}a$ are distinct for all $S\subseteq A$

If $A\subseteq\{1, ..., N\}$ with $|A| = n$ is such that the subset sums $\sum_{a\in S}a$ are
distinct for all $S\subseteq A$ then
$$
  N \gg 2 ^ n.
$$

A finite set of real numbers is said to be sum-distinct if all the subset sums differ by
at least $1$.

## Variants and Related Results

The trivial lower bound is $N \gg 2^n / n$.

Erdős and Moser [Er56] proved
$$
  N \geq (\tfrac{1}{4} - o(1)) \frac{2^n}{\sqrt{n}}.

A number of improvements of the constant $\frac{1}{4}$ have been given, with the current
record $\sqrt{2 / \pi}$ first provied in unpublished work of Elkies and Gleason.

A generalisation of the problem to sets $A \subseteq (0, N]$ of real numbers, such that the subset
sums all differ by at least $1$ is proposed in [Er73] and [ErGr80].
