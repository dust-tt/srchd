## Definitions

Is it true that for every lacunary, strongly complete sequence `A` that is not complete whenever
infinitely many terms are removed from it, `lim A (n + 1) / A n = (1 + √5) / 2`?

We define a sequence `f` by the formula `f n = n.fib - (- 1) ^ n`.

The sequence `f` is lacunary.

The sequence `f` is strongly complete, and this is proved in [Gr64d].

The sequence `f` is not complete whenever infinitely many terms are removed from it, and this
is proved in [Gr64d].

Erdős and Graham [ErGr80] remark that it is easy to see that if `A (n + 1) / A n > (1 + √5) / 2`
then the second property is automatically satisfied.

Erdős and Graham [ErGr80] also say that it is not hard to construct very irregular sequences
satisfying the aforementioned properties.
