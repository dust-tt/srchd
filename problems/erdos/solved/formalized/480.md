## Definitions

Let $x_1,x_2,\dots \in [0, 1]$ be an infinite sequence. Is it true that there are infinitely many $m, n$
such that $|x_{m+n} - x_m| \le \frac 1 {\sqrt 5 n}$?

This was proved Chung and Graham.

## Variants and Related Results

For any $ϵ>0$ there must exist some $n$ such that there are infinitely many $m$
for which $|x_{m+n} - x_m| < \frac 1 {(c-ϵ)n}$, where
$c= 1 + \sum_{k \ge 1} \frac 1 {F_{2k}} =2.535370508\dots$
and $F_m$ is the $m$th Fibonacci number. This constant is best possible.
