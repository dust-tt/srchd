## Definitions

If `A ⊂ ℕ` is a finite set of integers all of whose subset sums are distinct then `∑ n ∈ A, 1/n < 2`.
Proved by Ryavec.

## Problem Statement

The predicate that all (finite) subsets of `A` have distinct sums

## Variants and Related Results

If `A ⊂ ℕ` is a finite set of integers all of whose subset sums are distinct then `∑ n ∈ A, 1/n^s < 1/(1 - 2^(-s))`, for any `s > 0`.
Proved by Hanson, Steele, and Stenger.

We exlude here the case `s = 0`, because in the informal formulation then the right hand side is to be interpreted as `∞`, while the left hand side counts the elements in `A`.
