## Definitions

The referee of [Er79] found the example $M(96, 7) > M(104, 8)$, showing that there are cases where
$M(n, k) > M(m, k + 1)$ with $m \geq n + k$.

Write $M(n, k)$ be the least common multiple of $\{n+1, \dotsc, n+k\}$.
Let $k$ be sufficiently large. Are there infinitely many $m, n$ with $m \geq n + k$ such that
$$
M(n, k) > M(m, k + 1)
$$?
The answer is yes, as proved in a strong form by Cambie [Ca24].
