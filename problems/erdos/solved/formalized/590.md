## Definitions

Let $α$ be the infinite ordinal $\omega^{\omega}$. It was proved by Chang [Ch72] that any red/blue
colouring of the edges of $K_α$ there is either a red $K_α$ or a blue $K_3$.

## Variants and Related Results

Specker [Sp57] proved that when $α=ω^2$ any red/blue
colouring of the edges of $K_α$ there is either a red $K_α$ or a blue $K_3$.

Specker [Sp57] proved that when $α=ω^n$ for $3≤ n < \omega$ then it is not the case that any
red/blue colouring of the edges of $K_α$ there is either a red $K_α$ or a blue $K_3$.

Let m be a finite cardinal $< \omega$. Let $α$ be the infinite ordinal $\omega^{\omega}$.
It was proved by Milnor that any red/blue colouring of the edges of $K_α$ there is either a
red $K_α$ or a blue $K_3$. A shorter proof was found by Larson [La73]
