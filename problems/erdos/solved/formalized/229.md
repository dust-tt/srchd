## Definitions

Let $(S_n)_{n \ge 1}$ be a sequence of sets of complex numbers, none of which have a finite
limit point. Does there exist an entire transcendental function $f(z)$ such that, for all $n \ge 1$, there
exists some $k_n \ge 0$ such that
$$
  f^{(k_n)}(z) = 0 \quad \text{for all } z \in S_n?
$$

Solved in the affirmative by Barth and Schneider [BaSc72].

_the derivatives of an entire function_. Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. (1972), 229--232.

Let $\{S_k\}$ be any sequence of sets in the complex plane, each of which has no finite
limit point. Then there exists a sequence $\{n_k\}$ of positive integers and a
transcendental entire function $f(z)$ such that $f^{(n_k)}(z) = 0$ if $z \in S_k$.
