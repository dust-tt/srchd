## Definitions

Let $a_n$ be an infinite sequence of positive integers such that $\sum \frac{1}{a_n}$ converges.
There exists some integer $t \ge 1$ such that $\sum \frac{1}{a_n + t}$ is irrational.

This was disproven by Kovač and Tao in [KoTa24].

## Variants and Related Results

In fact, Kovač and Tao proved in [KoTa24] that there exists a strictly increasing
sequence $a_n$ of positive integers such that $\sum \frac{1}{a_n + t}$ converges to a rational
number for all $t \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $t \ne -a_n$ for any $n$.
