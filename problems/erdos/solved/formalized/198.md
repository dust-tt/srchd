## Definitions

Let $V$ be a vector space over the rationals and let $k$ be a fixed
positive integer. Then there is a set $X_k \subseteq V$ such that $X_k$ meets
every infinite arithmetic progression in $V$ but $X_k$ intersects every
$k$-element arithmetic progression in at most two points.

At the end of:
 * Baumgartner, James E., Partitioning vector spaces. J. Combinatorial Theory Ser. A (1975), 231-233.
the author claims that by "slightly modifying the method of [his proof]", one can prove this.

The statement for which Baumgartner actually writes a proof.

If $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is a Sidon set then must the complement of $A$ contain an infinite arithmetic
progression?

Answer "yes" according to remark on page 23 of:

- Erdös and Graham, "Old and new problems and results in combinatorial number theory", 1980.

"Baumgartner also proved the conjecture of Erdös that if $A$ is a sequence of positive integers with
all sums $a + a'$ distinct for $a, a' \in A$ then the complement of $A$ contains an
infinite A.P."

But this seems to be a misprint, since the opposite is true:
There is a sequence of positive integers with all $a + a'$ distinct for $a, a' \in A$ such that the
complement of $A$ contains no infinite A.P., i.e. there is a Sidon set $A$ which intersects all
arithmetic progressions.

So the answer should be "no".

This can be seen, as pointed out by Thomas Bloom [erdosproblems.com/198](https://www.erdosproblems.com/198),
by an elementary argument.

In fact one such sequence is $n! + n$. This was found by AlphaProof. It also found $(n + 1)! + n$.
