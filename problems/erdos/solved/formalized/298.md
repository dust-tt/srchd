## Definitions

Does every set $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ of positive density contain some finite $S \subset A$ such that
$\sum_{n \in S} \frac{1}{n} = 1$?

The answer is yes, proved by Bloom [Bl21].

Note: The solution to this problem has been formalized in Lean 3 by T. Bloom and B. Mehta, see

## Variants and Related Results

In [Bl21] it is proved under the weaker assumption that `A` only has positive upper density.
