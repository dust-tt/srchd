## Definitions

Let `f = ∑ aₖzⁿₖ` be an entire function of finite order such that `nₖ / k → ∞`.
Then `limsup (fun r => ratio r f) atTop = 1`. This is proved in [Fu63].

Let `f = ∑ aₖzⁿₖ` be an entire function such that `nₖ > k (log k) ^ (2 + c)`.
Then `limsup (fun r => ratio r f) atTop = 1`. This is proved in [Ko65].

Is it true that for all entire functions `f = ∑ aₖzⁿₖ` such that `∑' 1 / nₖ < ∞`,
`limsup (fun r => ratio r f) atTop = 1`?

## Problem Statement

An entire function `f` is said to be of finite order if there exist numbers c, a ≥ 0
such that for all `z`, `‖f z‖ ≤ c * rexp (‖z‖ ^ a)`.
