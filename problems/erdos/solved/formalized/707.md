## Definitions

**Erdős Problem 707**: It is false that any finite Sidon set can be embedded in a perfect
different set modulo some $n$.

As described in [arxiv/2510.19804], a counterexample is provided in [Ha47], see below.
The proof of this has been formalized.

Alexeev and Mixon [arxiv/2510.19804] have disproved this conjecture, proving that $\{1,2,4,8\}$
cannot be extended to a perfect difference set modulo $p^2+p+1$
for any prime $p$.

Alexeev and Mixon [arxiv/2510.19804] have disproved this conjecture, showing that $\{1, 2, 4, 8, 13\}$ cannot be
extended to any perfect difference set.

This conjecture was actually first disproved by Hall in 1947 [Ha47], long before Erdős asked
this question.
A counterexample for any modulus from from [Ha47] in the paragraph following Theorem 4.3, where it
was given as $\{-8, -6, 0, 1, 4\}$, but this can be shifted to natural numbers
as pointed out in [arxiv/2510.19804].

## Variants and Related Results

It is false that any finite Sidon set can be embedded in a perfect
difference set modulo `p^2 + p + 1` for some prime power `p`.

As described in [arxiv/2510.19804], a counterexample is provided in [Ha47], see below.
The proof of this has been formalized.

It is false that any finite Sidon set can be embedded in a perfect
difference set modulo `p^2 + p + 1` for some prime `p`.

As described in [arxiv/2510.19804], a counterexample is provided in [Ha47], see below.
The proof of this has been formalized.

A perfect difference set modulo `n` must have size `≤ √n + 1`.

The Singer construction gives perfect difference sets for `n = p^2 + p + 1` where `p` is a
prime power.

The set `{1, 2, 4}` is a Sidon set.

The set `{1, 2, 4}` can be embedded in a perfect difference set modulo 7.

For small Sidon sets, we can check the conjecture directly.
