## Definitions

If $\mathbb{R}^2$ is finitely coloured then must there exist some colour class which contains the
vertices of a rectangle of every area?

Graham, "On Partitions of 𝔼ⁿ", Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A 28, 89-91 (1980).
(See "Concluding Remarks" on page 96.)

Solved (with answer `False`, as formalised below) in:
Vjekoslav Kovač, "Coloring and density theorems for configurations of a given volume", 2023
https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09973
In fact, Kovač's colouring is even Jordan measurable (the topological boundary of each
monochromatic region is Lebesgue measurable and has measure zero).

## Problem Statement

Erdős problem 189 asked whether the below holds for all rectangles.

## Variants and Related Results

Graham claims this is "easy to see".

Seems to be open, as of January 2025.
