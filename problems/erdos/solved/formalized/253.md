## Definitions

Let $a_1 < a_2 < \dotsc$ be an infinite sequence of positive integers such that
$\frac{a_{i+1}}{a_i} \to 1$. If every arithmetic progression contains infinitely many
integers which are the sum of distinct $a_i$ then every sufficiently large integer is
the sum of distinct $a_i$.

## Problem Statement

The predicate that `a : ℕ → ℕ` is a strictly monotone sequence such that every infinite
arithmetic progression contains infinitely many integers that are the sum of distinct $a_i$s.
