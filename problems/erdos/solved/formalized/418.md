## Definitions

Are there infinitely many integers not of the form $n - \phi(n)$?

This is true, as shown by Browkin and Schinzel [BrSc95].

## Variants and Related Results

It follows from a slight strengthening of the Goldbach conjecture that every odd number can be
written as $n - \phi(n)$.
In particular, we assume that every even number greater than 6 can be written as the sum of two
*distinct* primes, in contrast to the usual Goldbach conjecture that every even number greater than
2 can be written as the sum of two primes.

Erdős has shown that a positive density set of integers cannot be written as
$\sigma(n) - n$.

A solution to erdos_418 was shown by Browkin and Schinzel [BrSc95] by
showing that any integer of the form $2^(k + 1)\cdot 509203$ is not of the
form $n - \phi(n)$.

It seems to be open whether there is a positive density set of integers
not of the form $n - \phi(n)$.
