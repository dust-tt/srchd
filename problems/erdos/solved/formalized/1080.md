## Definitions

`IsBipartition G X Y` means that `X` and `Y` form a bipartition of the vertices of `G`.

Let $G$ be a bipartite graph on $n$ vertices such that one part has $\lfloor n^{2/3}\rfloor$
vertices. Is there a constant $c>0$ such that if $G$ has at least $cn$ edges then $G$ must
contain a $C_6$?
