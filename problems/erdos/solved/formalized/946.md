## Definitions

There are infinitely many $n$ such that $τ(n) = τ(n+1)$. Proved in [He84].
Here τ is the divisor counting function, which is `σ 0` in mathlib.

/--
The number of $n \le x$ with $τ(n) = τ(n+1)$ is at least $x / (\log x)^7$ for all sufficiently
large $x$. Proved in [He84].

Improved lower bound in [Hi85]: $Ω(x / (\log \log x)^3)$.

Upper bound in [EPS87]: $O(x / \sqrt{\log \log x})$.
