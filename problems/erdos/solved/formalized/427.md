## Definitions

The predicate that for every $n$ and $d$, there exists $k$ such that
$$
  d \mid p_{n + 1} + \cdots + p_{n + k},
$$
where $p_r$ denotes the $r$th prime?

**Erdős Problem 427**: is it true that, for every $n$ and $d$, there exists $k$ such that
$$
  d \mid p_{n + 1} + \cdots + p_{n + k},
$$
where $p_r$ denotes the $r$th prime?

**Shiu's theorem**: for any $k \geq 1$ and $(a, q) = 1$ there exist infinitely many $k$-tuples of consecutive primes
$p_m, \dots, p_{m + k - 1}$ all of which are congruent to $a$ modulo $q$.

Cedric Pilatte has observed that a positive solution to Erdős Problem 427 follows from Shiu's theorem.

## Problem Statement

The statement of Shiu's theorem:
for any $k \geq 1$ and $(a, q) = 1$ there exist infinitely many $k$-tuples of consecutive primes
$p_m, \dots, p_{m + k - 1}$ all of which are congruent to $a$ modulo $q$.
