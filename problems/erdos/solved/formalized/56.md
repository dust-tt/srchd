## Definitions

A singleton is `k`-weakly divisble if `k ≠ 0`.

No non-empty set is `1`-weakly divisible.

`MaxWeaklyDivisible N k` is the size of the largest k-weakly divisible subset of `{1,..., N}`

/--
An example of a `k`-weakly divisible set is the subset of `{1, ..., N}`
containing the multiples of the first `k` primes.

Suppose $A \subseteq \{1,\dots,N\}$ is such that there are no $k+1$ elements of $A$ which are
relatively prime. An example is the set of all multiples of the first $k$ primes.
Is this the largest such set?  To avoid trivial counterexamples, we must insist that $N$ be at
least the $k$th prime.

## Problem Statement

Say a set of natural numbers is `k`-weakly divisible if any `k+1` elements
of `A` are not relatively prime.
