## Definitions

The set $\{ z \in \mathbb{C} : \lvert f(z)\rvert\leq 1\}$

**Erdős Problem 1043**:
Let $f\in \mathbb{C}[x]$ be a monic polynomial.
Must there exist a straight line $\ell$ such that the projection of
\[\{ z: \lvert f(z)\rvert\leq 1\}\]
onto $\ell$ has measure at most $2$?

Pommerenke [Po61] proved that the answer is no.

## Variants and Related Results

On the other hand, Pommerenke also proved there always exists a line such that the projection has
measure at most 3.3.
