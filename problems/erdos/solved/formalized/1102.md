## Definitions

If `A = {a₁ < a₂ < …}` has property P,
then `A` has natural density `0`.
Equivalently, `(a_j / j) → ∞` as `j → ∞`.

Conversely, for any function `f : ℕ → ℕ` that goes to infinity,
there exists a strictly increasing sequence `A = {a₁ < a₂ < …}`
with property P such that `(a_j / j) ≤ f(j)` for all `j`.

Every sequence with property Q has upper density at most `6 / π^2`.

There exists an infinite sequence $A = {a₁ < a₂ < …} ⊂ \mathsf{SF}$ where
$\mathsf{SF} := \mathbb{N} \setminus \bigcup_{p} p^{2}\mathbb{N}$, i.e. the set of
squarefree numbers. The set `A` has property `Q` and natural density `6 / π^2`.
Equivalently, `(j / a_j) → 6/π^2` as `j → ∞`.

## Problem Statement

Property P : A set $A ⊆ ℕ $ has property P, if for all $n ≥ 1$ the set
$ \{a ∈ A | n + a\text{ is squarefree}\}$ is finite.
