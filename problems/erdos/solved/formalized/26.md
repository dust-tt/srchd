## Definitions

A sequence of naturals $(a_i)$ is _thick_ if their sum of reciprocals diverges:
$$
  \sum_i \frac{1}{a_i} = \infty
$$

A sequence of naturals $(a_i)$ is _Behrend_ if almost all integers are a multiple of
some $a_i$. In other words, if the set of multiples has natural density $1$.

A sequence of naturals $(a_i)$ is _weakly Behrend_ with respect to $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}$
if at least $1 - \varepsilon$ density of all numbers are a multiple of $A$.

Let $A\subset\mathbb{N}$ be infinite such that $\sum_{a \in A} \frac{1}{a} = \infty$. Must
there exist some $k\geq 1$ such that almost all integers have a divisor of the form $a+k$
for some $a\in A$?

## Problem Statement

The set of multiples of a sequence $(a_i)$ is $\{na_i | n \in \mathbb{N}, i\}$.

## Variants and Related Results

If we allow for $\sum_{a\in A} \frac{1}{a} < \infty$ then Rusza has found a counter-example.

Tenenbaum asked the weaker variant where for every $\epsilon>0$ there is
some $k=k(\epsilon)$ such that at least $1-\epsilon$ density of all integers have a
divisor of the form $a+k$ for some $a\in A$.
