## Definitions

Prove that, for any finite set $A\subset\mathbb{N}$, there exist $a, b\in A$ such
that
$$
  \gcd(a, b)\leq a/|A|.

## Variants and Related Results

A conjecture of Graham [Gr70], who also conjectured that (assuming $A$ itself
has no common divisor) the only cases where equality is achieved are when
$A = \{1, \dots, n\}$ or $A = \{L/1, \dots, L/n\}$ (where $L = \operatorname{lcm}(1, \dots, n)$) or
$A = \{2, 3, 4, 6\}$.
Note: The source [BaSo96] mentioned on the Erdős page makes it clear what
quantifiers to use for "where equality is achieved". See Theorem 1.1 there.

TODO(firsching): Consider if we should have the other direction here as well or
an iff statement.

Proved for all sufficiently large sets (including the sharper version which
characterises the case of equality) independently by Szegedy [Sz86] and
Zaharescu [Za87]. The following is taken from [Sz86].

There exists an effectively computable $n_0$ with the following properties:
(i) if $n \ge n_0$ and $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ are distinct natural numbers then
$\max_{i, j} \frac{a_i}{(a_i, a_j)} \ge n$.
(ii) If equality holds then the system $\{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\}$ is either of the
type $\{k, 2k, \dots, nk\}$ or of the type
$\left\{\frac{k}{1}, \frac{k}{2}, \dots, \frac{k}{n}\right\}$.
