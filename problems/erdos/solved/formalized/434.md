## Definitions

The number of naturals that cannot be written as the sum of
finitely many elements of the set $A$, with repetition allowed.

Let $k \le n$. What choice of $A\subseteq\{1, \dots, n\}$ of size $|A| = k$
maximises the number of integers not representable as the sum of finitely
many elements from $A$ (with repetitions allowed)?
Is it $\{n, n - 1, \dots, n - k + 1\}$?

Let $k \le n$. Out of all $A\subseteq\{1, \dots, n\}$ of size $|A| = k$,
does $A = \{n, n - 1, \dots, n - k + 1\}$ maximise the number of integers
not representable as the sum of finitely many elements from $A$ (with repetitions allowed)?

## Problem Statement

A natural $n$ is representable as a set $A$ if it can be
written as the sum of finitely many elements of $A$
(with repetition allowed).
