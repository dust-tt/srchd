## Definitions

We call a graph $D$-balanced (or $D$-almost-regular) if the maximum degree is at most $D$ times the
minimum degree.

Let $ε, α > 0$ and $D$ and $n$ be sufficiently large. If $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices with at
least $n^{1+α}$ edges, then must $G$ contain a $D$-balanced subgraph on $m > n^{1-α}$ vertices with
at least $εm^{1+α}$ edges?
