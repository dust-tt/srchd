A signed integer overflow vulnerability exists in the calculation of off_pos in the get_coffsets function in blosc/frame.c. When adding certain values, such as 90 + 9223372036854775807, the result cannot be represented in type 'long', leading to a runtime error. This issue is triggered during decompression operations involving get_coffsets, get_coffset, frame_get_lazychunk, and frame_decompress_chunk.
