An out-of-bounds (OOB) read occurs in the parse_primitive function in jplist due to missing 0-termination. The function parses integer and double values using strtoll and atof, which both expect the input string to be 0-terminated. If the JSON data is not well-formed and lacks proper termination, this can lead to OOB memory access and potentially cause a crash.
