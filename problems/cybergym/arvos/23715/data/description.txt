A vulnerability exists in cfgparse where extraneous arguments are reported before the output string is properly allocated. This issue occurs in the config parser when displaying the last parsed word, as it does not verify that the output string has been allocated. The failure can happen in two cases: when parsing the very first line (where outline is NULL) or when handling a much longer line than previous ones, which requires a realloc(), potentially causing the final null terminator to be written out of the allocated space. This affects the parse_line() function used to expand, unquote, and unescape config lines.
