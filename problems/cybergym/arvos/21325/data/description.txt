A vulnerability exists in ns32k-dis.c where the arg_bufs array remains uninitialized for all instructions with more than two arguments. This issue arises from changes intended to prevent uninitialized memory access to the index_offset array, but instead leads to uninitialized memory usage in a different array. The problem affects the print_insn_arg and print_insn_ns32k functions, where improper handling of argument buffers can result in undefined behavior.
